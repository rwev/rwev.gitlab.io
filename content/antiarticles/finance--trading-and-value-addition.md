Title: Trading Profits and Value Addition

Traders make profit that shouldn't actually exist if markets were efficient, friction-less, liquid, and completely transparent.

Any profit they make in the process of contributing to the formation of efficient markets does add value to society (although very abstractly) and the profits they make are fair compensation for doing so.

Market efficiency and trading profits should be inversely correlated (?). The trading industry make growing profits year after year, albeit as market grows on a nominal level.

But there is significant evidence that trading firms _do not_ act in such a way that they advanced the integrity of the market. Many trading firms profit by perpetuating the inefficiencies and manipulating them for their own gain, at the expense of outsiders (general entities holding financial interests).

In efficient markets, traders price financial instruments separate from each other, and the market consensus becomes the value ("the wisdom of the crowd") as the market pushes the price there by net buy or selling. This is _fundamental pricing_.

A substantial proportion of algorithmic trading activity is not driven by willingness to participate in the process of superior valuation. Many traders have no opinion on the true value of the instrument. Instead, they function almost exclusively using information on how other traders are acting. The "wisdom of the crowd" mechanism does not function when the members of the crowd don't think and act independently. Capital doesn't flow in and out of companies (with the buying or selling of stock) based on business prospects, but instead on nominal price (and its history) listed on the exchange. That is _technical_ trading and it's premise nearly defines _market inefficiency_.

This baseless buying or selling activity is nonsense for any other non-financial assets, so why should it be _embraced_in the financial markets? An individual or a business would be crazy to base buying and selling decisions of real assets without doing analysis of their own. Would any rational individual make the decision to purchase a television based solely on how many televisions were sold to their counterparts? Would a factory run by prudent managers make the decision to sell their industrial equipment based on how their rivals are purchasing it?

Efficient markets value instruments solely on their market-independent underlying worth; inefficient markets value things arbitrarily.

Some traders provide a useful service, such as the high-frequency players that use technology to ensure the same price for the same instrument over the world _(the law of one price_). Others are vandals and public enemies of the market.
### Logical Pricing and Time Horizon
Many seen long-term investing as more valuable society. This is natural, as the connection between the money flowing from capital markets into businesses which invest in real assets is a long term process. But short-term trading adds value (read: "efficiency) "to the markets too.

Just as short-term interest rates anchor long-term interest rates (because short-term rates compound to long-term rates), short-term market efficiency anchors efficiency over the long-term. Short-term traders, when trading on fundamentals, logically regulate market movement on the daily or intra-day time frame in response to news, reports, and annoucements. This way, assets are continuously repriced by the collective trading community, and information is integrated into prices promptly. Longer term investors can then enter or exit the market at a fair value, whenever that may be.
### Absolute Value versus Relative Value
On an absolute basis, trading adds value to society through the facilitate investment, risk transfer, and price discovery process. Markets need buyers _andÂ _sellers:

	- For a company to raise funding by going public and _selling_ stock, investors stand ready to _buy_ the stock
	- For a commodity producer to hedge its price risk and _sell_ forward, speculators (often spreaders) are ready to _buy_forward
	- For an institution to _buy_ insurance on a debt position of non-zero duration, options market-makers _sell_ insurance

Contributions to price-discovery are not limited to certain types of trading: short-term vs. long-term, directional, arbitrage, spreading, macroeconomic vs. microeconomic, or speculation.

On this basis, trading adds value.

But how much value does trading add compared to what the very smart mathematicians and computer scientists could otherwise be doing? The list of alternatives with more ostensible benefit to greater society is endless:

	- designing public infrastructure
	- national security through technology
	- medicines and treatments

It's fair to assume that most people entering the field can sympathize with this. But they go anyway, because it pays more. Hard to blame them.

But in a just society, people are payed based on the value they add to society. This begs to question, is there pay unjustified, or otherwise not a fair measure of the value they add to the larger society?

### Conclusion
All financial services add value, _because there is a demand for them._ We need accountants, investment banks, and proprietary traders, even though they don't make anything and appear to just move numbers between abstract financial accounts. They play an unarguably vital role in a function of our economy and are just an important for development of a well-functioning society as engineers and doctors.

Machines aren't to blame; they perform the algorithmic trading that has taking place since the existence of standardized financial exchanges, albeit at a much faster pace. Demonizing technology in and of itself has never been a valid response; it is only a fight-or-flight response of starving old industries.

Recognize that the entire trading industries encompasses lots of investment hypothesis, risk-taking intentions, market outlooks, as well as corresponding activities to engage in the execution. All trading firms or divisions that deal in trading are not cut from the same stone.

As a final note, err on the side of free markets rather than sloppy regulation. However well-intended, regulation, when not thoroughly thought out, creates crony markets, which are almost always worse than _free_ markets. The best regulations are ones that concisely address a clear externality.

If a free market creates an externality, regulations can and should address it. Is _technical trading_ an externality? It seems like it. However, it is impossible to regulate. That said, popular targets of complaints regarding modern financial markets are _not_externalities:

	- Trading with strategy (based on fundamentals?) at any time frame is not an externality.
	- Low-latency (high-frequency) trading is not an externality (in and of itself; exchange collusion requires further discussion on a future post)
	- Mathematical modeling (based on fundamentals?), however complex and intimidating it may seem to the general public, is not an externality.

Traders add value to the markets so long as they add efficiency to the markets, and these things, however widely demonized, do just that.
