Title: It's You vs. You

In my relatively short time on this earth, I'm not quite a wise man of wise man. But there are a few things I've picked up along the way. Here's one of them.

_"It's you versus you."_

Perhaps my favorite motto on sustainable self-development.

If there is one abstract, philosophical line I could draw to separate those I've observed achieve the most success over the years from those who've achieved little, it would separate those who live and breath for inner aspirations from those who merely get by by satisfying or yielding to external authorities, peers, or social expectations.

For a primitive example, I lifted weights regularly in college with one of my best friends. In weightlifting, it's you, the person lifting the weight and yearning for self-improvement, and the weight itself, an inanimate object.Â In order to reach the next level, there is no brown-nosing, no office politics, no sympathy, no easy way out. _You_ have to put in the work. And the only who who can make you do that is you. Fittingly, "y_ou versus you_" is what we'd yell at each other in preparation for the next set.

It is the only thing that will sustain you through the _marathon_ of life. In this marathon, success isn't just a matter of how you start out -- your skills, habits, and personality traits -- rather how you _hold_ out.

Whether on a religious basis or a purely secular desire to be the best human possible, find your inner aspiration. Appeasing to external authorities is cheap in the short term, but dear in the pursuit of a fulfilling journey of growth. Be motivated from within.

In the end, you are the only one holding you accountable.
