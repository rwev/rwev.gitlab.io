Title: Now
Status: published

I currently work for a financial automation and analytics company, [Clearwater Analytics LLC](https://www.clearwater-analytics.com/), in Boise, Idaho.  

I work on some digital projects, which you can find on [github](https://github.com/rwev) or [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/rwev). I sometimes write about them on this site; [here's](tag/contribution.html) a place to start. 

When offline (a state of being I value very much) I like to be adventuring outside, the ramblings of which, both philosophical and practical, I write about on my other blog [coyote.life](http://coyote.life).
