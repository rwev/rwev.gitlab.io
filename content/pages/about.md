Title: about   
Status: published

This site, [rwev.dev](https://rwev.dev), is my digital log, thought repository, and progress journal, where I check in and explore topics in software, user-centric design, data, and privacy. 

It is a mix of reference notes, defenses of projects, presentations of design, super-user documentation, investigative experiments, and deeper dives into questions of pragmatism, principle, and purpose in the space of technology and information.

I write about pursuits and wanderings of every dimension on my personal site, [coyote.life](https://coyote.life).
