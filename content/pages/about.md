Title: About   

Hi, I'm Ryan William (*rwev*).

In my private life, among friends and family, or in the solitude of nature, the richest and most fulfilling moment stem from reflecting on large concepts - not just abstractly, but connecting them into the intricacies of work, recreation, future vision, day-to-day priorities, and physical adventures.

First and foremost, that putting words onto the electronic paper of our time may crystallize my internal thoughts and instincts and reduce them to a readable, digestible form. One learns by explaining, and this comes with the positive by-product of the spread of knowledge and perspective.

A mix of public / shared notes, projects, learning experiments, and deep dives into big questions. 

## Guidelines
There are some standards on plan to follow with the content of this site. 

### Current and Prospective
There is obviously a lot one has already experienced by the time he gets to the point to start writing about it and sharing it on the inter-webs. Although there is lots I would like to add regarding past experiences, I will not do so on this site. All post will be current experiences,  or in the case of notes and reference materials, things that provide ongoing tangible value in my life. The past is the past, and this site didn't exist in the past; therefore retrospective content won't exist on this site. 

### Informal, Uncensored, Grammatically Questionable, and sans Citations
This site will be a thought repository - _not_ a scientific journal, formal debate stage, or politically correct publication. I plan to move fast, and add content insofar as it satisfies my desire to put the thoughts onto paper. This does not involve grammatical knit-picking or appeals to authority via citations. Think colloquial.
