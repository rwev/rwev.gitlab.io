Title: Out of (Corporate) Office, Forever

After about 18 months working at corporate development shops, I've begun to seriously 
consider it's consequences. 

First is the health aspect. I notice this because on the weekends, my energy level rises immensely to it's peak on Sunday evening. The next morning, within the first few minutes of sitting at my desk, resumes to normal "functioning" work energy. This is probably a consequence of both the lack of physical movement / low metabolism as well as a psychological side effect of the numbingness of the present engagement. 


"Putting in the time" as opposed to having a personal vested interest in the matter (SITG).
"Doing your job" as opposed to doing something that matters.


A tranquil heart (heart at peace) gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones. - Proverbs 14:30 King Solomon

His way forward, how to escape envy, comparison, and jealousy, mentally and spiritually.

... all toil (work, labor) and all achievement spring from one person's envy of another. This too is meaningless, a chasing (pursuing) the wind. - Ecclesiastes 4:4 (see Eccl. 1:14 also) King Solomon

Words of the wisest, _and_ the richest man of all time.

But only a fool would fold their hands and ruin themselves - by not attempting to compete and accomplish. This isn't about non-productivity or a justification of laziness. He continues:

"Better to have one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind" Eccl 4:6

Remove what makes you feel less than, causes comparison and discontentment, or stirs envy or jealousy, flee from it.


How to evaluate the purpose of your work: am I chasing approval, to compete, to compare, to prove myself? Opt for work in fulfillment and enjoyment rather than the two handfuls. Am I on a quest to prove myself to others, or to fulfill my own destiny?

You will never be what you were created or designed for (God's purpose) as long as you are looking over your should at the doings of others.

Find the race that God has for you to run, staying in this lane, to quit looking at the other lanes. Then can you work both _harder_ and with more inner _peace_. 

Less is more when it leads to peace and contentment. Peace with yourself. 

Find your one handful and your tranquility. Thrive there, and change the world of others.
The moment we leave our race, and begin to compare and become jealous and envious, we lose our ability to truly care for others. Envy is selfish. Envy takes one's attention and steals it all for itself. In your lane with your handful, you can do more for other people than when you take two lots for yourself. 

Use the lives of other for inspirations rather than imitation --

Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, instead of someone else today. --

Count _your_ blessings. Not your neighbors. Counting your own blessings leads to gratitude, and gratitude forms generosity. 



You cannot compete or compare your way to peace. You cannot win by chasing the wind.
