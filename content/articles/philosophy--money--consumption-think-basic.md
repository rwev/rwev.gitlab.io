Title: Think Basics

What is a mass-produced, wide-scale, ubiquitous item that accomplishes roughly the same as a specially produced, oversold, over-spec'd, over-engineered product?

Fly-fishing sling < Fanny Pack
Nalgene / Yeti / Camelbak < Plastic Bottle
Waterproof bag / container < thick ply zip lock

The general / versatile is cheap and often works better given SAWC, which are nearly everywhere.
