Title: On System Redundancy
Category: philosophy
Series: redundancy

The enabler of the modern economy is specialization. Only specialization, and the levels of efficiency it offers, is capable of mass production of our day. 

Specialization implies that an entity is very good at performing its actions in a static environment with a set of predictable, replicable factors that exhibit [ergodic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodicity) behavior. A drastic example of this is on the assembly line: for one operator to apply her operation at an industrial level of efficiency, the state of the input object is strictly controlled.

Specialization and its relationship with efficiency, though economic concepts, can extend to any space in which entities interact with their environment, an environment offering differing levels of certainty. 

More broadly, an entity must only be prepared for what it will experience, and in the case of a ergodicity, what will be experienced is known, and so that entity must only "invest" in what will prepare it best. In fact, it doesn't _need_ to be prepared at all. Further, in this condition the entity has the ability to optimize - when assumptions can be made, the yields of optimization are much greater. This means the neglect of the extraneous: unless a tangible or intangible asset can be applied for profit to the task, it is forgotten. 

Specialization is the naive way of preparing for the unknown, in general.  

But with specialization comes fragility - entities that perform only in the space of the known, the static, the predictable - over-invested in their current environment and unable to adapt when the necessary assumptions become untrue. 

# Fragileconomics 
When profit is the motive, efficiency is the chorus. Efficiency _enables_ profit. Profits cannot be increased without efficiency. This is the essence of capitalism and laissez-faire economics. 

What does this produce? Entities in the modern economy become overspecialized and oversensitive. They can't adapt. As soon as their set of assumptions their business model is built on fall apart, so do they, also bringing down the networks with a domino effect, propigating to their neighbors. 

As they said, you don't need it until you need it (replace "it" with any form of preparation, anything seen as extraneous, unnecessary, frivilous given the profit motive - for example, downside insurance. It only costs money in the short run!).

So what is the solution? Entities in the market could become more aware of downside, and make themselves more adaptable. This involves investing in assets, both intellectual and infrastructural, that don't immediately boost the bottoms line. Although increasing the wisdom / foresight / prudence of the entities is the place to start, this would require an overhaul of how the modern economy operates - an impractical consideration for now. 

The other solution would be to increase the redundancy of the system

A counterargument to this is that large nodes have the assets and brute strength require to bare large risks and the reserves to whether large storms. This is true - the likelihood of failure of a large node is much higher than than for a smaller one. But, _the bigger they are, the harder they fall._ A smaller explosion in the network, by the failure of a smaller node, presents less danger to its peers. Thus in the granular model, failures are more frequent, but the danger any given failure has to the system as a whole is significantly reduced. Failure should be commonplace - a continuous refining of the population for those most suited to a changing and dynamic environment. 


# Network Visualization
Think of any network - in this case, the economy. Nodes are businesses entities, whether multinational conglomerates or sole proprietorships. 

Consider the failure of any node - in this case bankruptcy or insolvency. This creates an _explosion_ in the network, damaging neighbors in the network by proximity. The larger the entity, the larger the explosion (a massive node, say a top Wall Street bank, will shock the network larger than an independent contractor).

This is precisely the meaning of the "Too Big to Fail". A node in the network is too large and critical and affects too many others that its failure could bring the entire system into structural collapse.

# Redundancy in Daily Life
Those were some rather abstract, high-level thoughts, but they find their applications in the minutiae of daily life. Here are some ways to live this out. 

## Separation over Combination
A simple application: prefer two separate containers over one. One large gasoline container requires only one purchase, and the cost / volume ratio generally of a generally decreases with size. One can store the same amount of gasoline for less money by choosing one large container over two smaller ones. 

However, when that one container fails, the gas is gone - a critical failure. You'll out of fuel with no fallback.

Two containers is a redundancy. When one fails, you still have gas, and the likelihood of critical error is significantly reduced.

Redundancy produces resiliency.

### Gear Choices
Integrate primaries and secondaries into your system. Although a "better" primary is likely more reliable and less failure-prone, it still can't match the robustness of two separate elements. Consider also the risk of loss - even if the primary doesn't fail, losing it leaves you empty handed. 

## Distribution over Centralization
Centralization is efficient. It enables entities to benefit from economies of scale underlying mass production and shared utilities. 

But centralization creates large nodes. When that one node fails, all dependent nodes are hung out. Sacrifice efficiency for redundancy, even at the cost of higher prices or other forms of expenditure. Redundancy is insurance, and it comes at a premium. Some are too afraid to "pay up" - even though the real danger is not doing so.
