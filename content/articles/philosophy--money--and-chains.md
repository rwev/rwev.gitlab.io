Title: Money and Chains

Money, or more broadly wealth, since the time of the Industrial Revolution, which broad a level of prosperity never before seen by humanity. Freed from the mundane and repetitive and volatile life on farms and fields, all basic human needs have been met, and are generally affordable and accessible to the majority of the population.

This advancement liberated society. It was then that the concept of free time became a commonplace concept, There was more time to reflect, focus, discover, _think_. 

In recent years, with the continued proliferation of marketing strategy and social media, society has relapsed. We are more distracted than ever, busier than ever, with our attention monetized, interpersonal relationships polluted by marketing and consumption-centric comparison. Society continues to be enslaved by the pursuit of more. Recent technological development, while promising "progress" in the depth of the human experience, instead has made it shallower than ever. 

After witnessing the condition of many colleagues at a growing corporation, hating their existence at work, not present or engaged, preferring to be anywhere else on earth than at their desk watching the clock. Celebrating Friday; despising Mondays. 

Meanwhile, they can't seem to imagine life differently. They don't, or aren't willing to, recognize alternatives. This is the existence that they grew into, were taught, inundated with, and receive positive confirmation for - the stereotypical, the safe, the manufactured definition of success. This amounts to a disappointing lack of autonomy, independence, and self-reflection. 

Back to money. Colleagues are paid amounts of money far and above the costs required to procure life's necessities and even basic creature comforts and pursuit of individual interests, with the remaining excess offering the freedom and flexibility for sabbaticals, breaks between jobs, unpaid time-off, and long vacations. So is how I see it. 

Instead I witnessed the opposite. The excess resources became collateral to offer to banks, who offer access to unreasonable amount of credit, absurd multiples of discretionary yearly income. After subtracting living expenses and some expensive tastes, the loans take decades to pay off. The young professionals do what they think "young professionals" do: take the banks offer for that house and for that car. 

Furthermore, the property underling the debt items are so often no where near necessary. A brand new, loaded out, overpowered extended cab truck for a software developer or business manager who commutes to work, and doesn't have the time or range of interests to get any use out of it. A two bedroom house in the suburbs for busy single man, with hardly and time or energy left at the end of the day to use kitchen or do basic cleaning and maintenance, let alone the unused rooms. It blows my mind that such purchases are typical.

What could set us free wraps us in chains instead.
