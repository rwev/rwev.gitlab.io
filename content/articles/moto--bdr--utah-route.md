An overnight backcountry adventure motorcycle trip. Approximately 1000 miles off-road in the high mountain and desert country of Utah. Blistering heat, rough terrain, and an old bike (for me at least, I'll be pushing Rhonda, my 1983 Honda XL600r to her limits.) A group of eight will be riding dual-sport motorcycles, and two will be manning the support vehicle, a 4x4 rig pulling a high-clearance trailer containing boondocking supplies (cooking gear, surplus water, beer, gasoline, etc.).

Here is our planned route. We'll be departing from St. George, UT in AM August 24. The forks in the route designate a split of the group: one way will be more difficult terrain (rocky, steep trails, generally inaccessible by 4x4) and the other more accessible to beginners and our support vehicle.

We will be camping a few nights and staying in rented forest service or AirBnB'd cabins the rest. Our itinerary:
