Title: Blood Tracking
Category: reference/hunting

### Blood Identification
- purple / green and slimy &rarr; gut
- pink / bright red and frothy / bubbly &rarr; lung (very high O2 content)
- red &rarr; artery (high O2 content)
- dark red / maroon &rarr; muscle or liver

### Approach after shot
After a potential hit, the best approach is to _wait_. Much of the time, the animal does not know what hit it. It will run in any which direction, and when wounded, will bed down, thinking it's safe and distracted by injury. The animal will remain there until death, if it was an imminently lethal hit (heart or lungs). 

If the animal is chased, it will realize what is happening and _run_, potentially for miles, even if critically wounded. There is no need to pressure the animal by entering pursuit too quickly. It's ultimately harder on the animal and hunter, and the kill may never be recovered. 

How long to wait? That depends on suspected shot placement:
- heart &rarr; 15 min.
- lung &rarr; 30 min.
- gut &rarr; full day (24 h)

There should be a 15 minute wait time _absolute minimum_ even if animal dropped instantly upon impact. It's simply not worth spooking the animal and needing to chase / track over long distance. 

Even seemingly perfect shots won't kill or drop, and animal tracks may be lost without a trace. It's part of the hunt, and wounding is accounting for in wildlife management policy.
