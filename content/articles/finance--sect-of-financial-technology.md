The basis of the "financial technology" is simplify access to financial services through technology. Cut out the bank, the office, and the broker, all of which represent a politically connected, monopolistic, authoritarian gatekeeper, with free reign over fees and product offerings. Shrink costs; expand access.

This holy conquest against the financial establishment is multifaceted:

Although not perfectly implemented throughout all of the branches of FinTech, here are what I have deemed the three central tenets of the FinTech creed:

	- *digitize;*
	- *decentralize;*
	- *democratize*

I believe cryptocurrencies and crowdfunding come closest to fulfillment.

For the most part, FinTech has found public embrace, perhaps due to the resistance to traditional financial institutions. Everyone can relate to aggravating experiences in dealing with the cumbersome, under-innovating establishment, for example with a bank to apply for a mortgage or auto loan.

It's widely accepted that people despise

	- fine print
	- lack of transparency
	- hidden fees
	- payment services deemed unworthy and / or obligatory
	- higher prices

On top of that, coming out of the crisis popularly blamed on "reckless" banks, customers are potentially more willing to consider alternatives.


## The Charters
Here are the greater missions of each sect of FinTech.

_Potential shortcomings are noted in italics._

#### Peer-to-peer Lending

Cut out the middleman. Let savers lend directly to spenders. Unlock the returns on lending that have been reserved for the bankers since the inception of lending.

_Lenders are potentially exposed to more risk, as the peer-to-peer originator vets the borrowers without its own skin in the game. More origination oversight is likely to come._

#### Crowdfunding

Democratize how capital is allocated in the economy. Fund projects based on individuals judge their worthiness rather than single-minded profit-centered corporations. Individuals have more sensitivity to externalities, (e.g. health and environment) than chartered corporations do, and are more in touch with their own demands.

#### Blockchain / Bitcoin

Transfer currency remotely and freely between individuals (or any two entities) without a central authority or fee-collecting middleman by utilizing public online ledgers, a system of bookkeeping using a peer-to-peer network. Faster, safer, and more practical than hard currency, yet remains untraceable.

#### Automated Investment Services

Popularize the services to customers with low net worth by offering lower minimum asset requirements. Provide the same long-term investment advice that human advisers provide at a much lower cost by having a machine run the numbers and re-balance the portfolio. Map client inputs to investment advice one-to-one, without the influence the conflicts of interest a sold-to adviser would present.

_Savings, investments, and allocation recommendations are only one part of the services a human financial advisers would provide. Estate planning, tax facilitation, and personalized accommodation (document management) for the older generations._

#### Mobile Banking
Control your bank account 24-7 from anywhere over the internet, without visiting a branch and commanding a representative over what to do with your own money. Reap the cost transfer from banks, which have significantly less operation (real estate, customer representatives) overhead, with higher interest rates and slashed or absent fee structure.

_I am of the opinion that mobile payments (e.g. "pay by swiping your phone"), often associated with mobile banking, is a trend. It offers no real functional advantage in the West (where consumer banking is widely available and utilized) over properly-secured plastic credit or debit cards, and continues to adds dependency on phone with limited battery life. It also maintains usage of a centralized transaction mediator (unlike cryptocurrency)._
