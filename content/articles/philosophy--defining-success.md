Title: On the Quest for Success, Transcend Envy
Category: spirituality
Tags: bible,work

I have found, in the ongoing process of self-reflection, that I have *overcome* something. It wasn't until recently that I pinned down what that _something_, from which I was freed, was. But now I have a better idea. 

That thing was *envy*. 

*Envy* has a myriad of manifestations, and like all other sins, it relates to others:
- *fear* of not being enough, of failure, of inadequacy
- _*Schadenfreude*_, or ill-will-wishing upon others, *spite*, *revenge*
- Constant *comparison* to others
- Unnecessary, misapplied competition
- Lack of fulfillment, contentment, peace; *ingratitude*

I didn't do things sincerely because _I_ wanted to, or because I felt a _higher calling_. I did them because they won me the approval and even the adoration of mentors and peers. My studies and work, all means to an end, to _have_ in abundance and to _hear_ the praises. 

As I found my way as a self-reliant individual in our capitalist world, my behavior became increasing _ends_-driven. I put aside, ignored, oppressed, disciplined-away any thoughts or pursuits that weren't a means to an end. Any decision was an economic one. All interests became ever more career-related. Creativity and monetization-free pursuits dwindled. Young and impressionable, I took all queues from the typical American dream: success is monetary, professional career make for a life well lived.

It only took a couple quarters as a "professional" take full notice of the failures in this peer/others/envy/fear-driven journey. The wrong turns became evident. And now, seven years after becoming a legal adult to begin to think independently and begin to settle on my own value system, one that has converged with the value system, especially as it relates to worldly pursuits and labor, of the Bible.

The endless comparison, fear of not having enough or not measuring up, drove me into a corner - one in which, by the world's standards, told me was the domain of success. 

Building a career, reputation, employable skills. 

In the words of King Solomon:

<div class="bible">
        <p class="content">
                A tranquil heart (heart at peace) gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.
        </p>

</div>

His way forward, how to escape envy, comparison, and jealousy, mentally and spiritually.

<div class="bible">
        <p class="content">
                Better to have one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.
        </p>
        <p class="annotation">
                Ecclesiastes 4:6
        </p>
</div>


<div class="bible">
        <p class="content">
                ... all toil (work, labor) and all achievement spring from one person's envy of another. This too (all things that are done under the sun) is meaningless, a chasing (pursuing) the wind.
        </p>
        <p class="annotation">
                Ecclesiastes 4:4
        </p>
</div>


<div class="bible">
        <p class="content">
                I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
        </p>
        <p class="annotation">

</div>

Words of the wisest, _and_ the richest man of all time.

But only a fool would fold their hands and ruin themselves - by not attempting to compete and accomplish. This isn't about non-productivity or a justification of laziness. He continues:

<div class="bible">
        <p class="content">
                Better to have one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.
        </p>

Remove what makes you feel less than, causes comparison and discontentment, or stirs envy or jealousy, flee from it.

How to evaluate the purpose of your work: am I chasing approval, to compete, to compare, to prove myself? Opt for work in fulfillment and enjoyment rather than the two handfuls. Am I on a quest to prove myself to others, or to fulfill my own destiny?

You will never be what you were created or designed for (God's purpose) as long as you are looking over your should at the doings of others.

Find the race that God has for you to run, staying in this lane, to quit looking at the other lanes. Then can you work both _harder_ and with more inner _peace_. 

Less is more when it leads to peace and contentment. Peace with yourself. 

Find your one handful and your tranquility. Thrive there, and change the world of others.
The moment we leave our race, and begin to compare and become jealous and envious, we lose our ability to truly care for others. Envy is selfish. Envy takes one's attention and steals it all for itself. In your lane with your handful, you can do more for other people than when you take two lots for yourself. 

Use the lives of other for inspirations rather than imitation --

Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, instead of someone else today. --

Count _your_ blessings. Not your neighbors. Counting your own blessings leads to gratitude, and gratitude forms generosity. 


You cannot compete or compare your way to peace. You cannot win by chasing the wind.
