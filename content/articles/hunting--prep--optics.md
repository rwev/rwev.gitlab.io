# Scopes 

## Components of a Scope
- *Objective Lens* - target side. Larger gathers more light for dim conditions (early and late in the day)
- *Tube / Body / Housing*
- *Erector* - elevation and windage knobs. Adjustments change optical path.
- *Magnification Ring* - around circumference of ocular lens - eye side. Multiple lens elements in barrel.

## Specifications
> (Magnification Range, in factor multiple) x (Objective Lens Diameter, in millimeters)
The popular 3-9 x 40mm configuration means that the scope offers magnification in the range of three to nine times, and has an objective lens diameter of 40mm. The numbers on my 2-7 x 32mm are correspondingly lower.

## Mounting

### Sight Height
1. Scope housing (tube) shouldn't contact rifle body, upper receiver, bolt, slide, or barrel. Scope should only come in contact with rifle via scope mount. 
2. Scope picture when cheek rested on rifle but in shooting position.

### Eye Relief 
The distance between ocular lens and eye when in shooting position. Proper eye relief should offer a clear scope picture.

Too short eye relief yields a small, inset sight picture, and the inside of scope tube will appear around picture (solid dark around image).

Too long eye relief yields gradient shadows around picture.

### Sight alignment

*Scope shadow* should also be eliminated with proper eye positioning. This is gradient darkness along sides of image. Scope shadow along one edge of picture will yield bullet path corresponding to the side the shadow is on, e.g. shadow along left rim will yield bullet left.

### Adjusting Windage and Elevation

On erector knobs, directions for clockwise / counterclockwise move the bullet in the corresponding direction. "UP" moves bullet impact up.
