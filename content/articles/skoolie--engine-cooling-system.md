Title: Engine Cooling System
Category: skoolie

After the drive and resulting pressure, the coolant leak manifested itself
again, larger than ever. The carpet at the front of the bus was soaked with
coolant. Need to disassemble the unit next on the left of the drivers seat to
investigate - seems like it's coming from the heater core.

Set out solve the @coolant leak. Took apart the heater core compartment to
driver's left. In the process found 2 / 3 heater fans still working, one routed
to provide heat under dinner table, and the other stock to blow at driver's
feet.

Upon getting everything apart and then turning engine on to build pressure in
the coolant system, the source of leak became obvious - the connection of copper
pipe to the heater core had cracked, and coolant was squirting out from there.

Removed the heater core completely, and used a section of 1" galvanized pipe to
bypass the heater core from the engine compartment side. In the process
I replace all 1" radiator hose in the engine bay.

I plan on holding off on replacing / repairing the heater core until colder
temperatures arrive.

I also took apart the other heating compartment, in front of the passenger
loading door, front right corner of the bus. There was no heater core within;
was already bypassed. Salvaged air flow fan and heater fan. Plan on keeping the
heater fan on hand in case one of the two on the left side gives out. The air
flow fan (exposed blades) will get installed in the roof hatch with a custom mount and get
a switch connection to the auxiliary battery.

JB-Stik welded the larger heater core. Doesn't leak now.
