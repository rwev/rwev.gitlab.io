Title: The Lessons of Foster

I had a particular professor in high school that has influenced my post-high-school life more than any other school official in the previous 17 years of my existence. He didn't do it with books - in fact he hated using a book, and only did so out after being pressured by the administration - but instead with his passion.

I learned Calculus well during this time - well enough to earn passing score on the Advanced Placement test for college - but learned even more about being successful in life.

#### Rising Above the Immediate Competition

Mr. Foster recognized the trend of high school students to become to comfortable just going with the flow. Many do what it takes to _just get by_. Don't put yourself "on the radar" by staying in the middle of the pack.  Being "above average" was used as a justification for complacency, leaving potential untapped.

In the light of this, he made an effort to make kids realize that for the rest of their lives, they won't be competing against the kids in their same small-town high school. *Average is relative*.

Average in high school means below average in college; average in college means below average in high-echelon organizational leadership; and on it goes.

With every step forwards, the competition becomes more fierce, and if you want to be average in the next phase, you need to be able to compete with the top X% of your current group, who will be competing with you in the next phase.

_Stay average_ by being average relative to the top X percent of your current peers.

#### Learning to Learn

The greatest teachings from high school and college isn't in the material itself. School is about learning how to learn.

In the case of Mr. Foster's calculus class, he would openly admit that none of us, except those going into academic research or teaching, would ever use calculus again, even if we were going into technical professions like engineering.

What was important was learning to *conceptualize and reason*, no matter how abstract or limited in usage the math was.

#### Understanding over Grades

Instead of mechanically developing the right answer for the purpose of homework or an exam, understand *why* such mechanism yields the right answer. Knowing why the correct answer is correct and why certain approaches are right and others are wrong is vastly more important than writing down the right answer on the exam paper.

It's an unfortunate disservice to students when teachers describe specific procedures to solve specific problems without explaining why it works. Students are then left to be monkeys, blindly repeated a boxed-in procedure. They simply learn to recognize what type of problem it is using black-box criteria that is not understood, memorize which black-box procedure yields solution, write answer, and repeat.

The problems of this approach accumulate over time, because *understanding beats procedure* in all further education, and also in the real world.

#### Don't Let Education Ruin Your Education

Bureaucratic, passionless delivery of education in many schools do more to hurt students by boring and demotivating them. 

Mr. Foster encouraged us to break out learning from from the system. Instead of putting his students on the hamster exercise-and-procedure hamster wheel, his entire syllabus was driven by understanding. 

In fact, instead of testing our ability to derive the right answers from problem sets, he would test us on our ability to explain how the problem was being solved. This was more than just showing your work - as the application of procedure produces that - but rather testing us on why we do what we do at each step.

#### The Forging Never Finishes

The work is never over. Just as you can't stop learning after school, it is impossible to let past achievements define you. You have to constantly be defining yourself, staking out your ground. Mr. Foster told us about alumni who wrote back to him:

<div class="quote">
        <p class="content">
                My freshman year was an identity crisis. It was the first time nobody knew who I was. I wasn't even anybody's daughter anymore. I had always been the best and the brightest -- what was I going to do now, walk around the dorm with a sign around my neck saying 'Former High School Valedictorian'?

        <p class="annotation">

        </p>
</div>

In words from his quote collection, which he passionately kept and taught from just as often as the calculus textbook,

<div class="quote">
        I feel keenly how much more rewarding it is to travel toward a goal than to reach it; for attainment lasts but a moment.
</div>

Education is an ongoing journey, a frame of mind, a way to live,  not a mechanized, bureaucratized system of stamps and certificates. See it that way, and one gets the most from it.
