I've read a lot of Paul Graham, and another one of his essays really struck a chord with me. Not to the tune of economics or technology or the wealth in between, but with the high school experience. 

I've extracted some of the most meaningful lines from Paul's essay _[Why Nerds Are Unpopular](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html)_ to narrate and further discuss them here. 

First, Paul notes the following tendency.

<div class="quote">
        There is a strong correlation between being smart and being a nerd, and an even stronger inverse correlation between being a nerd and being popular. Being smart seems to make you unpopular.
</div>

To be popular to or be smart? A student's capital, whether time or energy or emotional grit, is scarce. Kids make this allocation themselves, even if under the supervision of parents and mentors. To excel at something, whether science or popularity, one must allocate their personal resources to it. 

<div class="quote">
        The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things to think about... Few smart kids can spare the attention that popularity requires... Nerds serve two masters. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even more to be smart. And popularity is not something you can do in your spare time.
</div>

This is confusing, especially considering the insecure and vulnerable period of life high school takes place in.  Many don't realize the commitment that being popular takes. 

The popular kids thinking about being popular, while the smart kids are thinking about being smart.

They may even write it off as something that people "are just good at" as opposed to being practiced in, thus falling victim to the very common fallacy:

<div class="quote">
        In general, people outside some very demanding field don’t realize the extent to which success depends on constant (though often unconscious) effort... Likewise, popular isn’t just something you are or you aren’t, but something you make yourself.
</div>

#### Popularity and Persecution

Not all bullying (specifically _persecution_ among children) is driven by popularity. Bullying will happen independently of the popularity complex.

<div class="quote">
        Partly because teenagers are still half children, and many children are just intrinsically cruel. Some torture nerds for the same reason they pull the legs off spiders. Before you develop a conscience, torture is amusing.
</div>

Nonetheless, bullying is a integral part of the popularity system. So why is bullying a part the mechanism of popularity? Because

<div class="quote">
        Kids persecute nerds to make themselves feel better. When you tread water, you lift yourself up by pushing water down. Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think rank below... Most of the persecution comes from [semi-popular] kids, the nervous middle classes.
</div>

Furthermore, the distribution of kids is skew-normal, or pear-shaped when viewed vertically. So there are a lot more people making nerds unpopular (a.k.a. picking on them) than there are nerds.

But what is the deeper motivation for this?

<div class="quote">
        Popularity is only partially about individual attractiveness. It’s much more about alliances. To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that bring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings people closer than a common enemy... By singling out and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in the hierarchy create bonds between themselves... They don’t actually hate [nerds]. They just need something to chase.
</div>

What makes the system worse is the self-perpetuating nature of popularity. Once a kid gets made a target, kids would not otherwise persecute become afraid to associate themselves with them. Thus the persecution, when direct or indirect, builds.

<div class="quote">
        Unpopularity is a communicable disease; kids too nice to pick on nerds will still ostracize them in self-defense.
</div>

Thus the system of popularity, where kids become popular by condoning the unpopularity of others, resembles a _zero-sum game_. We can't all win. We can't all be popular. To be popular means other kids aren't popular.

#### Degeneration and Rebellion

Hierarchies of real people can and do form in the real world around all sorts of criteria. Most hierarchies have a purpose and a logical structure to achieve that purpose. The most obvious example of this is in large corporations and the military.

But in high school there is no objective that the social hierarchy needs to accomplish. Thus, "the situation degenerates into a popularity contest."

<div class="quote">
        Instead of depending on some real test, one’s rank depends mostly on one’s ability to increase one’s rank. When there is some real external test of skill, it isn’t painful to be at the bottom of the hierarchy.
</div>

Furthermore, in this hierarchy, it is _painful_ to be at the bottom of the hierarchy, because the _zero-sum_ popularity system that drives it. This isn't the case in most other hierarchies.

##### Nerd Problems, By-Product of the Specialized and Globalized Economy

<div class="quote">
        The primary purpose [of schools] is to keep kids locked up in one place for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done... in a specialized industrial society, it would be a disaster to have kids running around loose.
</div>

But adults work while kids learn has been roughly the system of since the dawn of civilization. What else has changed? The world as a whole has become more educated and advanced, placing the emphasis off of trades and onto higher education.

<div class="quote">
        Teenage kids used to have a more active role in society. In pre-industrial times, they were all apprentices of one sort or another, whether in shops or on farms or even on warships. They weren’t left to create their own societies. They were junior members of adult societies.
</div>

Kids joined the real-world workforce as early as 12 in pre-industrial times. Now, most don't until age 18 or 22.

Kids of centuries before worked and learned alongside adults. They were forced to engage in the real world, and what they learned, they _learned from the real world_.

They were also forced to recognize the wisdom and expertise of adults:

<div class="quote">
        Teenagers seem to have respected adults more then, because the adults were the visible experts in the skills they were trying to learn. Now most kids have little idea what their parents do in their distant offices, and see no connection between schoolwork and the work they’ll do as adults.
</div>

A higher education that kids cannot understand the full purpose of in their time.

<div class="quote">
        Teenage apprentices in the Renaissance were working dogs. Teenagers now are neurotic lapdogs. Their craziness is the craziness of the idle everywhere... Now adults have no immediate [productive] use for teenagers.
</div>

#### Nerds Fit Better in the Real World

<div class="quote">
        While the nerds were being trained to get the right answers, the popular kids were being trained to please.
</div>

Nerds don't fit in the made-up social structures of American high schools. And it's not just that the real-world consists of a majority adults that make nerds fit better. It's that the real world is large, and participating in central social structures is optional. One can _choose_ to constrain themselves to cliques that resemble the high-school parallel society by being a meathead or a gossiping house wife. It's isolated bubbles that "degenerate into savagery."

In high school society, nerds are often too small of a force to form a formidable social clique. But in a real-life sized pool, nerds "can achieve a critical mass if they clump together" and form groups where intelligence in the primary trait of envy.

Additionally, the choices one makes has real effects in the real world. And there,

<div class="quote">
        It’s no longer enough just to be pleasing. It starts to be important to get the right answers, and that’s where nerds show to advantage.
</div>

Nerds should recognize that the situation they are in isn't their fault, and to hold true until they are released from the high school bubble.

<div class="quote">
&nbsp;
        Nerds aren’t losers. They’re just playing a different game, and a game much closer to the one played in the real world. Adults know this. It’s hard to find successful adults now who don’t claim to have been nerds in high school.
</div>
