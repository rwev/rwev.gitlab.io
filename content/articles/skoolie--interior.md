We took an inventory of what we'd like to do to the interior of the
bus:
 - Paint the dark synthetic faux board throughout to a neutral nordic color.
 - Paint around driver's seat, electrical boxes, nordic also.
 - Tear out all carpet on walls. Undecided on replacement.

We've done a lot of work inside. Ripped out all @carpet in the bedroom, what was
on walls as well as the floor. Sanded and spackled the wood paneling, ready to
paint. Tore out carpet at front of bus - planning to replace with a tough,
waterproof flooring, possibly linoleum. Leaving the original carpet from the
start of dining area to the beginning of bedroom. Replacing it would be a large
project we don't really want to get into. We're planning on cleaning it very
thoroughly and then covering with rugs. We started painting the cabinet doors
in coolness of our apartment today.
