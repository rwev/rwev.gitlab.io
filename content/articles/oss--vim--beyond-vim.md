Within the first few months of using _vim_, I saw this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/bm0ihb/evolution_of_a_vim_user/) and related comments on reddit that I sympathized with, adapted to personal experience here.

## Journey of a _Vim_ User

1. Write and save your first file with _vim_
2. Discover _.vimrc_ and build your own frankenstein _.vimrc_ from snippets on the internet, while ignoring all the nearby comments to RTFM
3. Become allured by shiny plugins and spend 40 hours digging for them in Reddit threads and GitHub links, add them to _.vimrc_
4. Look at _.vimrc_ in horror, and realize that you don't actually understand _vim_ _or_ the plugins
5. Admit that you do need to [RTFM](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/R/RTFM.html), like people said all along
6. Realize that despite sophisticated editing mechanisms and endless customizability / extensibility, using _vim_ is hurting productivity

So, you switch back to zero-configuration IDE (JetBrains' IntelliJ) to focus on automating business value instead of your IDE. You relegate _vim_ to editing text files and commit messages and look back fondly on all that configuration you setup. Miss _vim_, but move on with life and appreciate your ability to automatically
 
 - interact with version control and databases
 - find and replace across the entire codebase
 - refactor code-aware
 - manage imports and dependencies
 - integrate file-watching and build tools
 - lint, and resolve warnings and errors with intelligent best-practice suggestions
 - fuzzy-find files, actions, symbols, and settings

all intuitively (at least for the GUI generation) and

 - _without_ cryptic _vim_-specific commands
 - _without_ learning _vimscript_
 - _without_ training and ingraining non-transferable keybindings and modal editing
 - _without_ the visual constraints of the terminal
 - _without_ books, ["quickrefs"](https://vimhelp.org/quickref.txt.html#quickref), [cheat sheets](https://vim.rtorr.com/), or even [RTFM](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/R/RTFM.html).

## Age as a Factor of Interest
My generation grew up with GUIs: they moderated our first interactions with computers and beyond. Knowledge of the terminal came only later, when I become interested in development. GUIs, as the point of first and continuous contact, were comfortable and homey, and the terminal foreign.    

But for the older generations of technologists, it was just the opposite. They grew up with the CLI, and GUIs were something that came later. Perhaps that is why the older generation prefers _vim_: it is a TUI, and as such shows itself in the place they feel most familiar with: the terminal. 

For youngsters, _vim_ is a sort of hipster, learning it a matter of paying tribute to those who have come before, a rite of passage, while the real work gets done somewhere else.  

## A Career Investment
When [grokked](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/G/grok.html), vim competes with modern IDEs, but learning _vim_ is a huge investment, and not one for the faint of heart. Gaining a return or reaching break-even requires a commitment on the scale of years, if not decades.
 
 The return of learning vim is more efficient text editing. However, most programmer time is spent reading, navigating, understanding, and planning. Editing itself is trivial and mechanical. Investments in efficiency are better made elsewhere. 
 
I don't even know if I'll be writing code in three years. In the meantime, I'd rather focus on my own valued-added development interests. Going further doesn't seem worth it. YMMV.

## The Reminiscence
My time with _vim_ was ultimate an exercise in Unix and everything it stands for. Having written my first code in a full-service, integrated IDE, learning how to use and configure _vim_ greatly increased the breadth and depth of my knowledge of programming tools and workflow. Programming in _vim_ emphasizes the [Unix philosophy](https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/~thenry/resources/unix_art/ch01s06.html): _vim_ is one tool alongside others in the kit of "Unix as an IDE" and exists alongside other under the rules of modularity, composition, and separation.
