Title: Tactical System Philosophy

Heavily influence by [Nutnfancy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbT5ssxEDZHNyz28N4Ov7Wg), my system is modelled by factors like: BOIS, 

- BOIS and the like
- SAWC
-

5.56x45mm caliber - adequate range and firepower, _lightweight_ ammunition.

System designed for simplicity: I want less stuff to thing about, to manage, to maintain, to carry accessories (e.g. batteries) for,
to lose, to carry. 

## The Assumptions
Every intentional system needs a set of constraints, which form the boundaries for the system and scope it to its service. 

### Distance
Armed conflict is assumed to be within a range of 0 - 200m, with the most likely scenario being 10 - 50m. 

### Unpredictability / Spontaneity of Conflict
The possibility of foreseen conflict, i.e. one that can be strategically and logistically prepared for, is very low. Fortifications cannot be built in advance for a specific threat. Conflict will instead happen on a moments notice and must be dealt with a natural, instinctive reaction time; there is no time beforehand to contemplate. 

### Discrete Optionality
The system should be discrete and reasonably concealable. Shows of militaristic force should be possible but optional.

### S.A.W. (Size and Weight)
THe system must be readily mobile and transportable over long distances on rough terrain, with a full backcountry loadout. The system should be comfortable and secure enough to run with. The system should be maneuverable and usable in a vehicle.






## Weapon System

### Choice 

### Deliberate Lack of Secondary 
A service pistol was distinctly foregone. A secondary weapon requires the introduction of a separate and exclusive weapon system, which introduces a second layer of complication. The secondary (given my choice of primary) can't share 5.56x45mm ammunition. 

Normally I can appreciate the value of redundancy in the mitigation of catastrophic failure, but in this case and under the system constraints, the cost-benefit ratio is too high. Having a *reliable*, versatile primary and having a lighter, trimmer loadout beats having a half-capable sidearm and carrying a separate load of ammunition for it.  

### Factory Fresh and Unmolested
Modifications are by default questionable. Firearms are complex systems, ruled by sensitive equations of physics and deliberate, sometimes low-tolerance engineering specifications. I prefer to leave complex systems alone. 

### Bare 
I like my gun without accessories.
 
*No optics*: they contain glass components, which is breakable, and the short-range suitable options (like a red dot, holographic, or ACOG) require batteries, which can fail and must be carried. Thus optics introduce both fragility and complication into system.

*No bipods*: they can't be effectively deployed instantly and  Bipods are heavy and this weight is introduced at the muzzle end of the weapon, reduces agility and targeting proficiency, adversely affected by the physical mechanics of leverage.

*Cleanliness*: accessories, in almost all cases, complicate the geometric shape of the weapon, introducing knobs and corners and edges, all of which can get hooked on obstructions and interfere, all the while adding weight. I like both the simplicity and ergonomics of the factory weapon, but your mileage may vary: ergonomic accessories may add net value for other users of other weapons.

### Carry System: Single Point 
Single-point systems introduce fewer interferences with gear in the loadout. Two-point slings involve two straps to get caught on, tangled, and wrapped around; single-point only one. Stowing and accessing the weapon is less complicated.   

Additionally for my weapon choice, with a folding rear stock, a single-point system is practically required to take advantage of the folding function for compact transport and close quarter situations. 

## Square One: Ultralight
Default choices: lightwight. 

There is a lot of very nice, heavy, durable, "mil-spec" gear on the market. 

Do you need "mil-spec"? Military rigs are often too heavy and there is military-specific / mission / bureaucratic requirements in their systems. 

"Mil-spec" tends to be both heavier AND more expensive. 

I would rather start cheap, which often correlates to lighter weight. Then, I test the gear under by _my_ requirements? Do it work under realistic conditions? 

If it does not reach expectations, which is very rare, it is often easy enough to make the necessary modifications / upgrades, such as reinforcing stitching or material.

## Gloves

Assuming one comes fully dressed, the only exposed skin on the body for movement and tactile application are the hands. These normally are not covered or protected in daily life. Allows for huge gains in the comfort and protection of
