Title: Tactical System Philosophy

Heavily influence by [Nutnfancy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbT5ssxEDZHNyz28N4Ov7Wg), my system is modelled by factors like: BOIS, 

- BOIS and the like
- SAWC
-

5.56x45mm caliber - adequate range and firepower, _lightweight_ ammunition.

System designed for simplicity: I want less stuff to thing about, to manage, to maintain, to carry accessories (e.g. batteries) for,
to lose, to carry. 

That said, I like my gun naked, for the following reasons: 
- Glass is breakable, and sights require batteries, which can fail and must be carried. Introduces fragility into system.
- Bipods are heavy. They can't be effectively deployed instantly. They are heavy and this weight is introduced at the muzzle end of the weapon, reduces controllability and targeting proficiency, adversely affected by the physical mechanics of leverage.
- Cleanliness. Accessories, in almost all cases, complicate the shape of the weapon, introducing knobs and corners and edges, all of which can get hooked on obstructions and interfere.


Modifications are by default questionable. Firearms are complex systems, ruled by sensitive equations of physics and deliberate, sometimes low-tolerance engineering specifications. I prefer to leave complex systems alones.

Single-point systems. Fewer interferences with other worn gear. Two-point slings involve two straps to get caught on, tangled, and wrapped around. 

For my KelTec SU-16C, with a folding rear stock, single-point slings are logistically required to take advantage of the folding function for compact transport and CQB situations.

## Probable Engagement Scenario

## Square One: Ultralight
Default choices: lightwight. 

There is a lot of very nice, heavy, durable, "mil-spec" gear on the market. 

Do you need "mil-spec"? Military rigs are often too heavy and there is military-specific / mission / bureaucratic requirements in their systems. 

"Mil-spec" tends to be both heavier AND more expensive. 

I would rather start cheap, which often correlates to lighter weight. Then, I test the gear under by _my_ requirements? Do it work under realistic conditions? 

If it does not reach expectations, which is very rare, it is often easy enough to make the necessary modifications / upgrades, such as reinforcing stitching or material.

## Gloves

Assuming one comes fully dressed, the only exposed skin on the body for movement and tactile application are the hands. These normally are not covered or protected in daily life. Allows for huge gains in the comfort and protection of
