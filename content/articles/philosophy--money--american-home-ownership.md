Title: Questioning the American Dream: Home Ownership

Gullible to the empty promise of bank marketing, in which one "rewards" themselves with a large financed purchase, a chunk of debt that they've "earned", many are over-eager to take out lines of credit offered them. 

The classic trap is housing. Something "I'm tired of paying rent; it's just money down the drain" and its derivatives are the ubiquitous words on the street, perhaps manufactured by the finance and banking cartel. So people take out mortgage credit when they _qualify_ but regardless of whether or not they can afford it (although affordability is relative; many have wildly different ideas of what this means). It's "investing in the long term", they tell themselves. 

Unable to afford a meaty down payment or a high monthly payment, they end up paying private mortgage insurance and make very little progress against the loan principle for the first many years of the loan. This equation evaluates to paying high amounts of interest  on top of the significantly higher maintenance and additional costs (time and money) involved in home ownership, versus the all-inclusive provisions in most rental arrangements. Younger home owners are particularly gullible to losses as they are more likely to relocate, and when they go to do so, find very little built-up equity when they sell. 

The American dream to "own", long favored by artificial and dangerous government policy, amount to paying rent to the bank, being a tenant who pays for or performs all maintenance on a property which the bank owns, makes hefty interest returns, with very little risk, as the tenant pays insurance on the downside risk for them. So much for "investment" - the only one with a steady return is the bank.
