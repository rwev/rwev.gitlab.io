After 1500+ miles on Rhonda, I'm exhausted. 

I started the trip riding down to Ogden, UT, where the group met and loaded the bikes into a rented box truck. This was 300+ miles on the highway coming from Boise, ID.

Once in St. George, the dirt began. The variety of landscape was incredible. I don't know of another place that offers a comparable contrast in scenery just hundreds of feet of distance or elevation apart.

We took a few detours from the route in the last BDR post. Firstly, we took Mesa Road of Hwy. 150 North near La Verkin, UT onto the Smith Plateau. It was a steep climb out of barren desert onto Smith Plateau / Mesa, which offered lush meadows, Aspen forests, and expansive views of the valleys below, and lead us into some lesser traveled roads in Zion National Park.

Second, we skipped Duck Creek Village, and instead headed north to Cedar City, UT from our camp on the Kolob Reservoir. Then we road Cedar Canyon Road southeast, turned left and headed north/east on State Routes 148 and 143 up to Panguitch, UT. This took us through Cedar Breaks National Monument and Dixie National Forest. Clear blue skies and strong sun. Thin, biting air at this elevation (topping 10,000 feet) took a toll on Rhonda's power (carburated). Evergreen forests and stark rolling grass meadows decorated with yellow blooms. 

Casta Canyon OHV trail was a highlight. A trail leading through boney, barren, sandy, red canyon up to another green high-elevation plateau. 

Skyline Drive in Manti-La Sal National Forest another, along the highest mountain ridges of the range. Well-maintained roads allowed speeds 45 - 65 mph with nonstop views of the valleys and lower ranges on both sides. Incomparable feelings of power and freedom. 

Cache National Forest was a hidden gem in the gem state, Idaho. I didn't know such features of terrain existed in the southeast corner of the state. Tight, moist, shaded valleys with beaver-dammed streams and green overgrowth promised good brook trout fishing opportunity (didn't partake) and dense forest with soft and nutritious undergrowth suggested good hunting. Traffic was minimal. On the list of places to visit for boondocking.
