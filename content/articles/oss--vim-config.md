Title: Built-in Vim Configuration

My first experience with vim was frustrating, as it is for many. Grown in a world of fully-featured IDEs, vim was barely usable or comprehensible without any configuration.

If I had to learn it again, I would use this configuration as a starting point, and if possible, _without_ plugins. Still maintain a general understanding what each line does. Add plugins incrementally and on a needs basis, so as to understand what the editor itself does, and what _specifically_ plugins do to extend that functionality.

I haven't found much use for custom keybindings, and I probably won't add any until [grokking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok#In_computer_programmer_culture) vim, with the exception of plugin integration.
