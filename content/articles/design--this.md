Why this website is the way it is. However simplistic, it is rich with purpose and principal, even though it may be [invisible](https://tannerchristensen.com/blog/2019/1/5/your-best-work-will-be-invisible).

In order be best understand the philosophy behind how this site is, examine the...

## Current State of Web Affairs
In the modern attention economy, websites steadily become flashier and flashier, with pretty JS and CSS powered animations, actions, and other forms of visual stimulation. 

This phenomenon is driven by advertising and their powerful psychological devices, sometimes the general naivety of favoring the new and shiny over the tried and true, or sometimes because of its innocently distracting eye candy quality. 

## Spirit of the Internet
While this trend dominates a huge chunk of internet traffic, this tendency runs contradicts to what I consider the foremost purpose of the internet: to provide an accessible and equitable means of sharing information. The web itself is a network of  _information_. 

Complicated website designs complicate the accessibility part, making cross-platform display trickier and more complicated. They also requires more power and network bandwidth, choking out older devices and using more grid power, having consequences in the realms of equality and environmentalism. 

The first and primary goal of web design should be to deliver the information. Anything that impedes or otherwise detracts from this goal should be avoided.

I don't mean by this that I can't ever appreciate slick animations or other code-based transitions. I do. But they are the cherry on top. The information is the cake itself. By and large, I don't venture onto the internet for a soothing visual experience. While it is definitely appealing and can make the experience more enjoyable, I visit for the information. 

Slick design isn't just frivolous, but it can detract from the experience, impeding smooth and transparent interaction with the information, often with [malicious psychological trickery with monetary motives](https://darkpatterns.org).

Enough with describing the dreary state of the web. What's a better approach? [Brutalist](https://brutalist-web.design) design is. 

## Brutalism

Brutalist design means 

<div class="quote">
    raw content true to its construction.
</div>

Brutalist principles can be applied to _anything_ design applies to: websites being one of many targets. 


### Transparency
Generally speaking, content behaves as expected. Ultimate priority is given to the information and concise navigation through it. 

This means, as quoted, 
```
Content is readable on all reasonable screens and devices
```

The default specification of the HTML suite of technologies delivers this by default, no frameworks in any language necessary. 


### Performance
It is _performant_. Brutalist websites rely as much as possible on the browser, which is a precompiled, tried and true, and iterated program built for accessibility and speed. Using the browser for site functionality is _fast_. JavaScript will never be as fast as the browser, or as reliable, or provide the same consistent interactive experience across websites. It is dynamically typed and must be parsed by the client `QED`.

That being said, JavaScript definitely has it's place. It can expand the functionality of websites into domains not built into browser. I use it on this website (link to map). But it is only loaded for domain-specific and contained functionality, and only loaded when absolutely necessary.
