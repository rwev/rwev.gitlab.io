Title: Exterior Electonics

We checked the exterior lighting. A few of the many brake lights, turn
signals, and one of the headlamps need fixing. Hoping it's just the bulb and not
the wiring. Will test tonight.

We inspected the exterior lights. A few of the turn
signals, brake lights were broken, but after taking them apart, it turned out
that just the bulbs were the issue - a big relief. ~12.77V was getting to each
socket. Didn't need to run any replacement wires the length of the bus.

Although both headlights get power, the right one is very weak. It's not the
bulb; I tested the left bulb in the right socket. Something with the harness
/ wiring is messed up, it gets less than 9V. Need to fix still.

We took the bus on a first test drive around the storage complex. Of course we
go ourselves into the only corner with no outlet, so we got some practice
backing the rig up. Definitely needs two people! I ordered some new convex
mirrors for the front corners (originals were gone) so that should help.
