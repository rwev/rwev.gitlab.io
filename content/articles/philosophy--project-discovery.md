Title: Discovery and the Hydra of TODOs
Category: philosophy

_*Adventurer*: one who ventures into the unknown, pushes and expands the boundaries of the known. Although they may possess maps and sketches, the adapt and adjust to new information.Unable to give up when the map is wrong, or there approach or assumptions become invalid._


The level of unknown in any project is very high. As humans, though, we have an affinity for structure and certainty. One way in which this manifests itself is through the TODO list.

A pattern I've learned in the course of personal project, both in software and otherwise (skoolie), is the process of project discovery. 

At time zero, requirements and spec's are vague - work needs to be done, but must first be crystallized and take form. 

So work starts. Things don't go as planned. Many times there is no backup plan, instead leaving the adventurer, deeper in growing problem space, without an idea of what to do next. Performing an item on a TODO list, instead of monotonously _increasing_ achievement, can actually _decrease_ that feeling. The TODO list grows and the adventurer

# The Misery
It easy to ride the high of a cool idea inside your own head. The thoughts become action, and the action becomes... failure. Most work is thrown away or forgotten over time. 

It would be nice to be able to conclude, through failure, that we've "been there, done that", and thus check off that approach from the space. 

But with failure, as new information, comes more discovery. The complications of the problem, with each dead end, reveal themselves, thus _expanding_ the space of possible approaches, rather than reducing it. 

This is the spite of the inventor, or the writer, or the scientist. 

This is the Dunning-Kruger effect, the equalizer of human hubris and illusory superiority. Project planning is the illusion that gives us undue confidence.
