- No connected accounts. (exception: login to Google through Windows for the Mail and Calendar applications)
- No shared permissions. No application access to central accounts, e.g. Google, Microsoft, etc.
- Deleted accounts from old email whenever possible, transferred the important / currently used to new email, unimportant accounts w/o sensitive information and no ability to delete remain. But email connection gone after deletion. 
- No shared passwords. Less convenient, but how often to I log in without autosave passwords, anyway? If one account compromised, then have your email and password, compromising all other accounts. All they have to do is try to log in to related sites with the same info. Once.
- Transition to open source alternatives whenever possible. Try not to remain within the product ecosystem of any one tech concern. Don't let them own you.
- Use Mozilla (Firefox) instead of Chrome, OSM (MAPS.ME) instead of Google Maps. It's okay to continue using selected products from major tech companies, but don't give them combined access. Distribute the dimensions of your life over multiple products and ecosystems. Do open source as much as possible. Diversify.
- This is a gradual process. Set goals. Don't attempt to make the transition over days or weeks. Months are better. Emailing / calling may be necessary to transfer some accounts.
