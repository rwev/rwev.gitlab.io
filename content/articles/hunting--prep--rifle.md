Recoil vs. Bullet Acceleration. Every action must have an equal but opposite reaction. The following equation represent the preservation of momentum:

(Recoil Acceleration) * (Mass of Rifle) = (Bullet Acceleration) * (Mass of Bullet)

This yields the following practical consequences:
- Heavier bullet <span>&#8594;</span> more recoil;
- Larger caliber / more powerful load <span>&#8594;</span> increased bullet acceleration more recoil;
- Lighter rifle <span>&#8594;</span> more recoil;
- Recoil pads dampen recoil acceleration <span>&#8594;</span> less recoil;

## Caliber Choice
Chosen round must penetrate flesh to a certain depth depending on game size (12" - 14" for elk) and deliver adequate hydraulic shock. Generally, due to the adverse effects of training with a high-recoil load (negative muscle memory in anticipation of shot leads to flinch and accuracy loss), prefer the smallest caliber needed to deliver lethal blow.

### Balance Penetration and Fragmentation
The bullet should deliver full energy transfer into target. It should not fragment too early, when the depth is to shallow. On the other hand, it should not go through the target, in which case bullet energy leaving the exit wound was lost and full fragmentation did not occur. The sweet spot is a bullet that fragments completely in the vital zone. 

### Standard vs. Magnum Calibers
Magnum loads are higher powered than their corresponding standard load. While bullet weight (grain) and casing width don't change, the cartriges are longer, and thus have more power. This translates into an exponential gains in bullet energy downrange (energy is proportional to square of velocity).

### Prefer Ubiquity
Start with the most common loads, as the scale at which such munitions are produced offers affordability. 

### Basic Caliber Reference
Common calibers ordered from low to high power:
1. 243 WIN (short action)
2. 7mm-08 REM (short action)
3. 270 WIN (long action)
4. 308 WIN (short action)
5. 30-06 SPRG (long action)

### Short Action vs. Long Action
Short actions are lighter weight, offer a shorter bolt throw for faster reloading. Better suited for shorter-limbed or weaker individuals. 

### Standard Rifles vs. "Mountain Hunting" Rifles
Mountain rifles are lighter weight, designed to be packed long distance over rough terrain for deep backcountry hunts. Per the recoil equation, this translates into higher acceleration and thus more felt recoil. Avoid unless weight is an absolutely critical factor in hunt - sacrifices accuracy due to recoil flinch. Recommended for experienced marksmen only.

## Ballistics (Bullet Trajectory)
Three major factors affecting trajectory:
1. *Gravity*: constant and predictable. Acts only in vertical direction.
2. *Wind*: unpredictable. Can act in any direction. Known, but changing, at shooter's position. Unknown downrange.
3. *Drag*: air resistance. Acts in direction perfectly opposite of bullet path, slowing it down. Magnifies the effects of gravity and wind.

Faster bullets have preferable ballistics, as faster travel reduces flight time over a constant distance to target and reducing the window for forces of gravity and wind to apply themselves.
