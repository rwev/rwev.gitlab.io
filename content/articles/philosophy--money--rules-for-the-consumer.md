In our consumer centric economy, it is hard to free ourselves from the powerful psychological influence of marketing, advertising, transactions, and envy. 

The powers that be, the A.F.G. machine, use their bankrolls to hire the best psychologists in the world in an effort to get inside our heads, and play on our greatest fears, insecurities, longings, and wishes, all with the ultimate motive of profiting from it (no, A.F.G. isn't around for the betterment of the world for the people, despite their seemingly innocent branding campaigns). 

Our consent to their profit motives and regulatory / political agenda is [manufactured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent#Propaganda_model_of_communication). The sources from which most get their information about the outside world, the media, are sold out, bought and paid for. 

Those obedient to this order are something between slaves and sheep. Society is so sold on convenience, from top to bottom, from the minor to major: it's easier to be lead by authority than to think independently.

We have been trained to think that doing or being someone requires _having_, and some sort of monetary expense.

Want to be "outdoorsy?" You need a Jeep with roll bars and winch and big fat tires, or a Subaru with the cage rack on top. Don't forget the bumper sticker assortment of your choice.
Want to be a mountain biker? Better have current model of bicycle, specialized clothing (no pun intended), and that pad hanging over your tailgate.
Want to be a fly fisher? You're going to need this overbuilt waterproof fishy-branded sling, and a novel pair of glasses, cap, plaid shirt, and rain jacket.

Build your own sentence with whatever free-time pursuit interests you. The market tells you that having one thing or another makes you that. And most of it is completely unnecessary for the _act_ of _doing_. 

We have been groomed into _buying_ our way into who we want to be -- that the first step in any pursuit is somehow consumption - looking the part. Everything that fits together, building the image on each transaction. And "if you don't pay for the product, _you_ are the product."

In the work-centric culture of the West, particularly North America, many are stuck in the work-spend cycle. Overworking themselves and having very little _time_ for other activities, they do the only thing they can with the money they earn and the little energy they have left: _buy_ their way into their desired image.

This analysis may seem grim. That said, the bounty of capitalism's cornucopia does offer us benefits, freedom, and indeed improvements to our lives, if, like anything, one indulges in moderation. How do we define this? What limitations should we set, so that the markets serve us, and not the other way around? How do we avoid being exploited by the material machine, while still using the markets to our advantage? Here are some guidelines.
 
## Check your Comparisons
Producers sell similar albeit marginally improved good years after year, and gullible consumers often replace what they own with whatever is the latest and greatest in that category of product. 

Equating the old with the inadequate is something producers like to do -- it yields predictable, multi-purchase consumers.

The replacement purchase often isn't driven by any sort of need or lack in function of that product (what is _does_),
rather to often made simply to _have_ the best of what is on the market and influenced by the psychological desire for
validation and legitimacy. 

This results in high and cyclical year-over-year expenditure in keeping up with the industry and little return to the consumer. 

So, one should compare what they have to its _ability_ to serve themselves in an absolute sense, instead of the relative comparison with what is on the market. Introspect before each purchase: is the producer inside my head and making my current and sufficient possessions feel inadequate, or is the product going to provide a distinct and abounding improvement on my experience with it?  

## Don't Buy the Marketing
Be aware of trends and producers attempting to exploit them. Producers exploit our wish to feel good about ourselves for profit.

For example, if a producers advertises their product as environmentally friendly, be automatically wary. 

No consumption is good for the environment -- using objects that already exists, even if that means repair and maintenance,
to its full useful life will always be better for the environment, as the environmental consequences have already been done, and 
any new production of that object will involve a new and separate environmental cost, even if that cost is lower. 

Put your guard up; stay skeptical. Always examine the meaning of an economic action or inaction from above.  

## Make it Last
There are times when replacement indeed becomes necessary. 
 
Before that time comes, do all that is in your power to repair, mend, customize, or otherwise work on what you do posses to make it further serve you. This will save money, the environment, and lead to more satisfaction when your possessions are rebuilt by you and for you.

## Seek Versatility 
As previously mentioned, producers want to make us feel like what we have is obsolete or insufficient, and that we need to buy theirs for legitimacy. This is almost never the case. Something you already own probably already does most of whatever the latest industry-specific piece does. 

In the rare cases when something is properly required in your pursuits, and you don't already own something that does basically the same thing, then look for the most versatile piece of gear that can be used productively in other pursuits. Give yourself options. Plan your purchases intentionally, with the goal of doing the most, and having the least. 

This rule doesn't apply to usage-specific / zero-tolerance gear, such as climbing safety equipment or fly-fishing line. Think more in the realm of lifestyle: jackets, bags, tools, and so on.
