Title: Rules for the Consumer

Tags: anticonsumption,environmentalism,stewardship

In our consumer centric economy, it is hard to free ourselves from the powerful psychological influence of marketing, advertising, transactions, and envy. 

The powers that be, the A.F.G. machine, use their bankrolls to hire the best psychologists in the world in an effort to get inside our heads, 
and play on our greatest fears, insecurities, longings, and wishes, all with the ultimate motive of profiting from it
 (no, A.F.G. isn't around for the betterment of the world for the people, despite their seemingly innocent branding campaigns). 
 
 Our consent to their profit motives and regulatory / political agenda is [manufactured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent#Propaganda_model_of_communication). The sources from which most get their information about the outside world, the media, are sold out, bought and paid for. 
       
 And "if you don't pay for the product, _you_ are the product."
 
 The obedient are slaves. Society is so sold on convenience, from top to bottom, from the minor to major: it's easier to be lead by authority than to think independently.
 
 That said, the bounty of capitalism's cornucopia does offer us benefits, freedom, and indeed improvements to our lives, if, like anything, one indulges in moderation. How do we define this? What limitations should we set,
 so that the markets serve us, and not the other way around?
 
 We have been groomed into _buying_ our way into who we want to be -- that the first step in any pursuit is somehow consumption - looking the part. 
 
 Want to be a self-respecting fly-fisher? You need this and that. etc. Most 
 of which is completely unnecessary for the _act_ of fly fishing - the _doing_, not _having_. Want to be "outdoorsy?" Well, you need a new jeep with the rollbars and winch.
 Want to be a mountain biker? Better have the latest gear, specialized clothing, hitch or roof rack, or that pad hanging over your tailgate. Everything that fits together, building the image on each transaction. Oh, yeah those racks, you probably wouldn't need them if your car served you.
 
 In our hyper-materialist consumption society we have been trained to think that doing or being someone requires having, and some sort of monetary expense.
 
 *wage slavery and the new plantation*
 
 This analysis may seem grim. How do we avoid being exploited by the material machine, while still using the markets to our advantage? Here are some guidelines:
