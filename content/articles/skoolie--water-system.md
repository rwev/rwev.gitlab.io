Title: Water System

On delivery, we charged the auxiliary battery and it held power. Interior lights lit right up,
and water pump started chugging too. Half expected everything to be broken and
need further assistance. Pleasant surprise!

We filled the fresh water tank. After turning the pump on
the lines quickly became clogged. The fresh water fill cap was missing during
the years that it sat, so organisms, dirt, etc got in. 

We also ran some more water through plumbing system. Because so much debris was
coming through the hoses at first, I thought the system was clogged after
a few seconds of runtime. After
manually pumping water with the hand pump, it turns out that the electric pump
just needs more time (~5min) to build up pressure before the water starts
flowing.

Put more water in, and pumped it through, periodically stopping to unclog sections of water tubing. 

The water pumped generate adequate pressure and the lines and tanks now seem clear. The water has a yellow tinge to it and smells like sulfur, so plan on removing the tanks from their mounts and cleaning them manually.
