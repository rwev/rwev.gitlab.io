Title: Insulation

We would like the bedroom to the the insulated capsule of the
bus, and isolated from the the elements and the rest of the bus alike. The walls
are bare, so we won't need to rip any finished feature out (just needed to rip
the low-pile carpet that was glued to the walls, same stuff as on the floor).

Because the interior is already
finished with all main living functionality in place (dining table, counter,
stove, oven, refrigeration, bathroom, shower, etc.), we don't want to go through
the trouble (descruction) of ripping all that out, insulating, and rebuilding.

The plan as of right now is to tear out the inner ceiling, currently attached
with small rivets and removable with crowbar (?) leaving the cross
braces, and fill between the braces with insulation (not decided which kind
yet), and replace the inner ceiling cover with a non-conducive material, e.g.
thin plywood. This approach preserves ceiling height.

For the walls, we will leave them in place, but build an internal frame with 1x2s, and fill in the skeleton with insulation like the @ceiling, and then secure a non-conducive on top to avoid thermal bridging.

The floor will be basic. Gut it, remove the low ply carpet, cut insulation
blocks, then layer with plywood, then finish with linoleum or cork. We will
leave the bed / water tank box where it is, because it is already sufficiently
insulated. It does need to be cleaned out though; it appears mice made a home.

Eventually, decisions will be made about whether to keep all the windows in the
bedroom (currently 3 on each side, then the 3 rear windows, one of which is in
the emergency exit door). I think the airflow of all the windows is well worth
the cost of lost insulation.

Finally, we'd like to put a @fan or @ac in the ceiling...
