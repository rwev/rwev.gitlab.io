Node.JS + TypeScript  &#124; Development Environment>

I'm just beginning to delve into using TypeScript for server-side Node.JS applications and for the client. After the discovery of and familiarization with some neat NPM packages, I figured I'd share how I used them to get a efficient and somewhat automated development environment set up.

### The Directory Structure
The code we are writing in the TypeScript language won't actually be used in production or deployment. The JavaScript code generated by the TypeScript compiler will be. Therefore, it makes sense to separate our super-set language code from code that the the web application actually runs on. This is achieved in the following file structure

[code language="powershell" gutter="false"]
PS C:\Users\...\nodejs-dev-env&amp;gt;tree &amp;gt; tree.txt
[/code]

The super-set and preprocessor source code will be contained in _./src_, while the compiled code will be in _./dist._

In visual studio code, the desired setup looks like this. Note the standard file extensions _.js _and _.css_  in _./dist_, and the super-set source code (in this case _.ts_ and _.scss_) in _./src_. The application will run on the server JavaScript _./dist__/app_, and serve the client with CSS and JavaScript in _./dist/public_.

Now that we've isolated the code we will edit from the code our application will run on, we can get to developing.

As we develop, we will want to test the code. For example, how does a client-side JavaScript file run look after I made a small change to the TypeScript that we compile it from TypeScript? Or how does the browser render the webpage after a change to SCSS source? Instead of executing the compiler on the file in question manually each time it is changed, we can use some handy-dandy NPM packages to do it for us.
