In yet another vein of economic philosophy gold from Paul Graham's _Hackers & Painters_ collection, the essay _[How to Make Wealth](http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html)_, addresses the interconnection between wealth and technological innovation. Here the ideas laid out within are pondered and further explored.

## How to Make Wealth

Paul begins by defining a start-up as a small company taking on a hard technical problem. A start-up is contrasted to business that fulfill a decades-old demand in old industry and carrying out the delivery of an invention or, fundamentally, a solution to a problem from years before.

It's important to remember that start-ups are just another form of business, albeit a type with particular advantages: hard-working and fast-moving. They don't exist inside of sphere of the guaranteed, like utility companies, so they must work hard and fast in carving out a place for themselves in the economy, sometimes bringing a whole new market with them.

> Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four. This pays especially well in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.


Furthermore, start-ups are in no case a shortcut to wealth: they are constrained to the old adage, "there's no such thing as a free lunch."

> They don’t change the laws of wealth creation. They just represent a point at the far end of the curve. There is a conservation law at work here: if you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars’ worth of pain.


He does concede that, seemingly for the average _successful_ startup, that
> You do tend to get a certain bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain, but you can’t evade the fundamental conservation law. If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.


People seem to have a different opinion about start-ups, as if they were a thing of legend. This is because the start-ups people know about are the wildly successful, having now unimaginably rich founders. As is true regarding the media on all topics, we only here about the non-normal, so the normal, i.e. the other 99% of the distribution, looks very different: full of strife, failure, and, frankly, big, brash bets.

> There is a large random factor in the success of any company. So the guys you end up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very smart, totally dedicated, and win the lottery.


## Moneymaking in the West

Money, as a transfer of wealth, can both be transferred or created. Wealth is the stuff people want. Wants are fulfilled by the transfer of stuff for other stuff, through the monetary medium. Wealth can be created; money can not.  The former has a very bad historical reputation, which continues until today: "speculation, marriage, inheritance, theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly, graft, lobbying, counterfeiting, and prospecting." In the past, before the rights protected by the West existed, these were the best ways to become wealthy. The creators of wealth became quick victims of the transfer of wealth due to the corrupt economic systems of the time.

Now, as a sign of how well the West has developed, the incentive to create wealth instead of manipulating out of the hands of others,

> The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich, is not just that it’s more legitimate (many of the other methods are now illegal) but that it’s more straightforward. You just have to do something people want.


The creation of wealth is correlated by the creation of money, which is done by governments as they employ fiscal policy. But wealth is not constrained by the creation of money: the wealth-value of money simply increases over time as wealth is created for a given money supply.

The most obvious creators of wealth are craftsmen. They make things that are tangibly useful to humanity and fulfill a want. No matter how what they create is divided, shared, or sold, the net wealth of humanity has increased.

The modern craftsmen is the computer programmer.

> A programmer can sit down in front of a computer and create wealth… They literally think the product, one line at a time.


The new brick is a line of code. The new electrical schematic is the program architecture.

## Cogs in the Wealth-Creation Machine

Companies that are in business, if they are to stay in business, need to create wealth (when this in not true, something has gone awry; remember the origination recipe for creating wealth: doing what others want).

> What a company does, and has to do if it wants to continue to exist, is earn money. And the way most companies make money is by creating wealth. Companies can be so specialized that this similarity is concealed, but it is not only manufacturing companies that create wealth. A big component of wealth is location. If wealth means what people want, companies that move things also create wealth.


But not every individual working for a company is involved directly in creating wealth. For example, human resources personnel at a factory manage those who run the machines in the factory.

> Everyone in a company works together to create wealth, in the sense of making more things people want. Many of the employees work at one remove from the actual making of stuff.


Nonetheless, insofar as people play a necessary role at a company, they are taking part in wealth creation, regardless of how abstract or intangible their workday is.

> the company as a whole must be giving people something they want, or they won’t make any money.


If you have a job, you are doing something people want. Even for the exception of extremely far-fetched and / or experimental job positions say that if a company is doing something people want, and it wants you, then transitively you are creating wealth.

#### Collective Companies and Individual Over-performance

Just as it is hard to separate the importance of each cog in a complex machine, it is hard to measure the contribution of individuals at large companies. Modularization and strict team separation helps, but the percent effectiveness of measure personal performance goes to 100% as the number of coworkers goes to zero.

> In a company, the work you do is averaged together with a lot of other people’s... companies are not set up to reward people who want to work harder than the average employee... A company that could pay all it's employees [as a perfect reflection of contribution] would be enormously successful [because] many employees would work harder if they could get paid for it [and] the company would attract people who wanted to work especially hard.



Employees present both fixed and variable costs, so minimizing employees by paying the variable costs to the employees who do want to work hard minimizes fixed cost, thus presenting a profit opportunity given an output level.

But unfortunately,

> There’s no way to untangle all their contributions.


## Getting Rich

> Since it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it has used essentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage, where measurement comes from working with a small group, and leverage from developing new techniques.


Paul proposes that two things must exists for someone to get extraordinarily rich from the wealth creation process: _measurement_ and _leverage_. Anyone who has such desires must put themselves in a situation where both are present.

> You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect.


Thus, as we follow the mathematical limit on measurement proposed earlier, start-ups are the preferred business vehicle for achieving the measurement condition.

> Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as most people can get to saying to one’s boss, I want to work ten times as hard so please pay me ten times as much.


With every additional coworker, the efficiency of measurement must decrease, as it certainly won't increase.

> The people you work with had better be good, because it’s their work that yours is going to be averaged with.


Because the number of people who do exceptional work is low, start-ups must remain small and consist of an exclusive minority of like-minded individuals, if the individual impact, i.e. the leverage of each, is to also remain high.

Paul formulates a perfect analogy for comparing the measurement / leverage situation at large companies versus small:

> A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers. Two things keep the speed of the galley down. One is that individual rowers don’t see any result from working harder. The other is that, in a group of a thousand people, the average rower is likely to be pretty average... if you took ten people at random out of the big galley and put them in a boat by themselves, they could probably go faster. They would have both carrot and stick to motivate them. An energetic rower would be encouraged by the thought that he could have a visible effect on the speed of the boat. And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likely to notice and complain.


## Technology Offers Leverage

When one works in the field of technology, he is guaranteed a certain level of leverage, because technology creates leverage: technology makes our decisions, or more broadly, effort, more impactful. The person who creates technology not only makes his own effort more potent, but also the effort of all of those who decide to employ his technology.

> What is technology? It’s technique. It’s the way we all do things. And when you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied by all the people who use it. It is the proverbial fishing rod, rather than the fish.... if you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about, you help everyone who uses your solution. That’s leverage.


The world of technology development moves faster than the normal world. When a technology is adopted in the normal world, it is usually kept around for decades, at minimum, before being replaced or improved by coexisting technologies. But in the world of technology, technology is developed, and has a correspondingly shorter lifespan before the decision is met by society to carry it forward.

> Fortunately there is a natural fit between smallness and solving hard problems. The leading edge of technology moves fast. Technology that’s valuable today could be worthless in a couple years. Small companies are more at home in this world, because they don’t have layers of bureaucracy to slow them down. Also, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches, and small companies are less constrained by convention.


## Surviving in the Wealth Creation Competition

Wealth creation, because of the monetary reward, naturally becomes a competitive process. How does one survive with his business intact?

Paul suggests that as a business moves through the decision tree of product development, they should use difficulty as a guide. He offers more delightful analogies to explain this:

> Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall aim of your company, but also at decision points along the way. At Viaweb one of our rules of thumb was run upstairs. Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big, fat, bully. You open a door and find yourself in a staircase. Do you go up or down? I say up. The bully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can. Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage. Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him... We delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitors to follow us over difficult ground...Like guerillas, start-ups prefer the difficult terrain of the mountains, where the troops of the central government can’t follow.


### The Contra

Startups will always be the small guys, but this in definitively not always an advantage: while start-ups may be nimble, they are weak.

> A startup is like a mosquito. A bear can absorb a hit and a crab is armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing: to score. No energy is wasted on defense. The defense of the mosquito, as a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little consolation to the individual mosquito.


Startups are a specialized species of business, and start-ups continue to exists (people continue to find reason to found them) because of the few that are successful.

## Users in Sight

With the vastly increased risk of failure and personal devastation that comes with founding a startup, one is forced to be more goal-oriented if the attempt is to be worth it. A startup simply can't exist or hold up through a business or technology cycle the way that the big boys can. So what goals should they have?

> It all comes down to users.


Why? Because users (normally) pay for your product (or figuratively through the tolerance of ads) when they become and stay users, and thus are the best measurement of its value. To think otherwise (rely on market analysis) is more speculative and certainly more expensive than this single measurement.

> Acquirers (the people who make startup founders rich, either through public markets or private investment) assume the customers know who has the best technology. And this is not as stupid as it sounds. Users are the only real proof that you’ve created wealth.


Furthermore, solving interesting or even difficult problems with creative or efficient solutions does not create wealth: it simply creates work. Not all problems must be solved. Difficult problems and their solutions are infinite; the wants to users, the people who pay business to solve problems, are more bounded.

> Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for. Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead of making users happy. In a startup, you’re not just trying to solve problems. You’re trying to solve problems that users care about.


Users aren't a perfect measure of worth of a business. For example, monetization must also take place between the two entities. But it's

> Certainly it’s a better test than your a-priori notions of what problems are important to solve, no matter how technically adept you are.


### User-Centric Startups

> Treating a startup as an optimization problem will help you avoid another pitfall that VCs worry about, and rightly—taking a long time to develop a product. Now we can recognize this as something hackers already know to avoid: premature optimization. Get a version 1.0 out there as soon as you can. Until you have some users to measure, you’re optimizing based on guesses.


> The ball you need to keep your eye on here is the underlying principle that wealth is what people want. If you plan to get rich by creating wealth, you have to know what people want. So few businesses really pay attention to making customers happy.


## Leverage, a Great Responsibility

As true with the physical definition of a lever, leverage works in both directions, clockwise and counterclockwise, progress and regress.

Leverage simply multiplies the impact of decisions. It does not make decisions better or even improve the decision-making process. It is a great power, which could be used for competitive advantage or competitive disadvantage, and must be handled accordingly.

> A restaurant can afford to serve the occasional burnt dinner. But in technology, you cook one thing and that’s what everyone eats. So any difference between what people want and what you deliver is multiplied. You please or annoy customers wholesale. The closer you can get to what they want, the more wealth you generate.


## Living Success Story

Talk like this isn't just theoretical or academic. It works, because the Western society that we live in is a product of this way of thinking.

This thinking is

> why Europe grew so powerful. Was it something about the geography of Europe? Was it that Europeans are somehow racially superior? Was it their religion? The answer (or at least the proximate cause) may be that the Europeans rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who made a lot of money to keep it.


The government of Europe evolved away from a feudal organization, where violence and political power (strongly related and often exercised together) was the path to richness and towards a system where wealth creation was protected, and the monetary incentive to innovate was preserved.

Although threats on this system have evolved, they continue to exist to this day -- crony capitalism, lobbying, over-reaching governments, and the creation of well-intended but poorly-implemented incentive structures implicit in certain public policy. Regardless of the political strain of the current times, we must never forget or falsely blame the system that brought us here:

> Don’t let a ruling class of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs. The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes countries powerful. Let the nerds keep their lunch money, and you rule the world.
