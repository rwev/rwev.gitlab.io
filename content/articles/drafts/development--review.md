## Role-specific requirements -2019 -Team member performs the day-to-day requirements of their job with a high degree of quality and reliability. They proactively problem-solve, seek help when needed, and involve others as appropriate within the scope of their role. What role-specific goals did you set for this year? What were your results? Example: My annual performance goal was to deliver quick, thorough, and accurate responses to customer inquiries.I attained 98% resolution on all cases closed.

Unafraid to seek knowledge and development wisdom elsewhere; ego does not interfere with job performance. Works well both independently and within a highly collaborative environment.  

## Job Knowledge-Understands duties and responsibilities, possesses necessary job knowledge and technical skills, maintains job knowledge current.

Maintains, deepens, and broaden understanding of both Clearwater toolset domain and currently deployed technologies, while broadening scope of technical knowledge. I believe my teammates would verify that I'm steadily becoming Clearwater-mature, while improving all-around as a developer.

### Judgement/Decision Quality-Makes good decisions based upon analysis, wisdom, experience, and judgment; most suggestions turn out to be correct and accurate when judged over time; sought out by others for advice and solutions.

As a developer from a non-traditional computer science background, I bring another perspective to the table and provide aspects sense of analysis and judgement that seem to be missed by sometimes overly eager traditional contributors.

One example of this is humility regarding tampering with the system. I play devil's advocate and offer a healthy dose of skepticism and caution against charging forward and making sweeping changes. Often I will estimate tasks as significantly more demanding and complicated than others contributors with high levels of technical "just code it out" hubris. This has saved the team (everyone's time) from being wasted on a few numerable occasions (one being the migration from one DB technology to another), increasing general business-value productivity.  

Additionally, my enthusiasm for principled development adds value to the team environment. It prevents us from getting caught up in a day-to-day implement / execute cycle and miss the forest for the trees. My reflection on the bigger picture adds unique value to the team and stimulates growth.



## Problem Solving Effective at identifying problems, taking initiative, serving up solutions, and executing a plan.

I participate as a collaborative member of the team to identify bugs and resolving them, with and without peer supervision, and within our decided priorities framework, on an urgent basis.

With the implementation of new features, I actively draw Clearwater best-practice while providing novel and creative solutions tailored to the use case (one example being non-investment cash flow feature in income forecast).
 
 Furthermore, my wellroundedness as a contributor (having balanced abilities on both the front-end and back-end) results in sensible and streamlined solutions, and adds to the initiative I am able to take on all fronts.  
 
 
 ## Prioritization- Spends his/her time and the time of others on whatâ€™s important; avoids getting distracted on less important tasks; can quickly sense what will help or hinder accomplishing a goal; eliminates roadblocks; creates focus.
 
 Answer here overlaps with "Judgement/Decision Quality". 
 
 Furthermore, I proactively counteract silo-ing of both myself and team members, which has proven to yield large, unmaintainable, black-box-like chunks that are hard to review and critique and can end up creating a large future time sink for the whole team. I have been a huge proponent of transparent communication and feedback cycle on the team before starting work on major changes or in navigating unfamiliar terrain.  
 
 
## Work Quality-successfully completes projects that are generally error-free. Overall work demonstrates role proficiency.

# Continuous Improvement-Embraces challenges and welcomes opportunities to grow and improve. Incorporates feedback and performs personal assessments to proactively improve work habits and processes.
Actively delegates time to learn and improve development workflow, both concretely (technical skills, languages, frameworks) and abstractly (engineering approach, analysis, planning, development mentality). 

# Personal and Team Accountability-Team member delivers what they say they are going to deliver when they say they are going to deliver it. They take personal accountability for their work and raise issues and concerns without placing blame when they encounter roadblocks or challenges. They offer their expertise when it adds value and they allow others space to do the same.

 
# Team Building -Can quickly find common ground and solve problems for the good of all; can represent his/her own interests and be fair to other groups; can solve problems with peers without creating new problems; is seen as a team player and is cooperative; gains trust and support of peers; encourages collaboration; can be candid with peers.

Encourages group participation and discussion and team-based planning and execution. Respects the opinions of others and understands the value diversity of thought in problem solving approach. 


#4 Focused on execution - The fourth of Clearwater's 7 Leadership Attributes is "Focused on execution." We do what we say we will, when we say we'll do it.

See comments on "Judgement and Decision Quality." Understands where the bridge between technical implementation and business value, and executes accordingly, where others get too drawn in to displays of technical prowess, I stay practical and efficient.

 ## 5 Intellectually curious and innovative-The fifth of Clearwater's 7 Leadership Attributes is "Intellectually curious, driven by continuous improvement, and constant in demonstrating innovation." 
 
Always open to new approaches, both logistical and technical, and willing to question and break the status quo. 

##7 Try New Things-The seventh of Clearwater's 7 Leadership Attributes is "Try new things and take chances." 
 See above. Enthusiastic about trying new things, even if they don't promise predictable returns or obvious relevancy. Innovation and discovery are cannot be bureaucratized and managed top-down; they are almost by definition a product of chance and serendipity.
