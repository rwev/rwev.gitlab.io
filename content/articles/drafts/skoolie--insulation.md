Title: Insulation
Category: skoolie

One issue with buying a skoolie that was already partially converted (relatively speaking), one issue that arises is retrofitting it. 

The bus didn't have much for insulation when we purchased it. Because the floor plan was already designed, built-in, framed, and paneled, removing it would be quite an undertaking, and fitting it back together another one altogether. So we decided to work around the framing, saving the time and puzzle. 

Starting with the bedroom: we decided to start here as this is the single place in the bus where warmth is absolutely critical for living comfort. Cold is more tolerable during the day when metabolic activity is higher, but can severely detract from quality of life during sleep. Because both walls in the bedroom were exposed upon purchase, this was also the most accessible area to insulate. We would turn this, before anything else, into a "homeostatic capsule" by fulling insulating it. The walls were bare, so we didn't need to rip any finished feature out (just needed to rip
the low-pile carpet that was glued to the walls, same stuff as on the floor).

Because the interior is already finished with all main living functionality in place (dining table, counter, stove, oven, refrigeration, bathroom, shower, etc.), we don't want to go through the trouble of ripping all that out, insulating, and rebuilding. We chose a non-invasive approach, relatively speaking, to insulating it. The standard, more invasive approach is to remove all of the interior metal paneling, frame out with 1x2s between the joists, and insulate between the framing. Although this preserves interior space, its simply not something we wanted to bite off. Destruction is much easier than construction, and heeding complexity and uncertainty, we left the walls as-is, choosing an additive approach: we used (R-Tech 1 in. x 4 ft. x 8 ft. R-3.85 Insulating Sheathing)[https://www.homedepot.com/p/R-Tech-1-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-R-3-85-Insulating-Sheathing-320821/202532854?MERCH=REC-_-pipsem-_-NA-_-202532854-_-N] adhered to the cleaned wall using (GREAT STUFF 16 oz. Gaps and Cracks Insulating Foam Sealant)[https://www.homedepot.com/p/GREAT-STUFF-16-oz-Gaps-and-Cracks-Insulating-Foam-Sealant-with-Quick-Stop-Straw-99053937/206977048]. 

Although the Great Stuff isn't marketed as an adhesive, it is extremely tacky, expands to fill its container, and cures to a firm, lightweight bond. This was a major plus in the bus, as the paneling on the 1979 bus was not flat and even malleable in places ("popping" is and out with application of pressure). The foam expands as it cures, filling the gaps in the bend metal panelling and the straight insulating board, and hardens resulting in a firm, and now even, insulated wall. There is no softness in the wall; it is very firm to the touch and certainly not going anywhere. 

For the floor, we took the same approach, but used the 1/2" variant of the insulation board to spare head height. 3/8" underlayment cut and placed over floor insulation to provide weight-distributive walking surface. 

We used 1/2" insulation for the ceiling as well, not only to once again preserve head height, but also because of its flexibility. Bent 4'x8' board can cover the ceiling from above the windows on each side. 

Eventually, decisions will be made about whether to keep all the windows in the
bedroom (currently 3 on each side, then the 3 rear windows, one of which is in
the emergency exit door). I think the airflow and natural lighting that the windows is well worth
the cost of lost insulation area.
