My buddy @collinbrewer always reminds me "be the entrepreneur and not the engineer".

As an engineer myself, I know how it goes, you start a new project, and you end up building too much. I would focus on how to accomplish things with either no code (reads: simply don't implement them, not to be confused with using some WYSIWYG builder) or by way of low code / simply "outsourcing" the mundane.

In regard to going low code, engineers by nature tend to want to own everything and build everything from the ground up. It's how we learn, we claim. We got to where we're at now by actually building stuff, right??

Wrong. At some point you have to acknowledge the limitations of your time, and take advantage of the plethora of resources available, but code dependencies (npm) and even third party software services (Auth0 and Stripe both coming to mind).
