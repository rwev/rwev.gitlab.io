Components of good rifle shooting: 
1. *Stable position*: bone-to-bone structure. Rifle or body should not be supported by muscle exertion. 
2. *Sight picture*: repeatable position with focus on sight picture.
3. *Natural breathing*: focus finishing trigger pull within respiratory pause.
4. *Trigger control*: slow, steady, deliberate _squeeze_

# Dry Fire Practice
It is possible to exercise all of the above, albeit without feedback, without any ammunition at all. Emphasize solid, repeatable, simple, supported shooting positions. 

_Slow is smooth, smooth is fast_

# Safety
The three rules:
1. Treat every weapon as loaded.
2. Never point weapon at anything you don't intend to shoot.
3. Keep finger off trigger and safety on until ready to shoot.

It is permissible and welcomed to intervene due to the immediacy of danger in a precarious range situation such as as improperly handled weapon. Do not let politeness or courtesy deter from correcting a potentially grievous circumstance.

## Shoot, or Don't 
In the controlled environment of the range, there are only a couple of conditions which warrant a cease-fire such as people downrange. But in a hunting environment, in which the hunter (shooter) and target are mobile, the uniqueness of each trajectory or bullet path warrants independent examination of whether discharge is permissible. 

Some things to keep in mind: 
- backstop
- shooting upward over ridges
- bullet deflection due to obstacles (brush, rocks, other debris)
