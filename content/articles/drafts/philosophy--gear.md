Living in an ever-more commercialized and monetized capitalist western economy, it is easy to become overwhelmed at the plethora of choice in gear of all kinds: whether it is everyday clothing, accessories for free-time pursuits, household products, we are inundated with choice. 

As such, marketing is _made_ to make us discontent and inadequate with what we have, a tried and true psychological approach, playing on the human desire for comfort, approval, and even lust. But the truth of the matter is that what we have, just the basics, _are_ adequate. 

It's marketing that gets us to buy brands, whether in the quest to be legitimized in the eyes of our peers, or so that we have an inflated sense of confidence in the make and origin of what we own. 

Thus we enter a cycle of purchasing. Take any given hobby, whether it's fly-fishing or mountain biking. There are a whole host of items on the market which offer gear "specific" to that hobby, built and "engineered" for that specific application. But at the end of the day, much of it in a just manicured and branded versions of generic items. There are certainly some exceptions, where the specificity of the application require a specialized gear item. 

Before purchasing, determine just _how_ different the item is from a generic, and just _how_ critical that difference is. Items on the market for a free-time pursuit are often substantially more built, e.g. extremely durable, 100% waterproof materials, than generics, but often this is unnecessary. How often does one need a equipment bag that is built to that specification? 

Examine your own pursuits, and determine the need for such features. 

Moreso, as an individual with many interests and pursuits and a variety of free-time activity, the scope of which is likely to continue widening as life goes on, one things I _don't_ like is having to manage all the gear that comes along with it. I don't want to have a fly-fishing specific bag, a adventure motorcycling bag, and one for each as such. Multiply this for the number of free-time pursuits. I would rather have generics, items that accomplish 90%+ of what the application-specific item would accomplish, than have the fork out the cash and subsequently manage / store / clean / organize an item for each application.

This leads us to our first tenet of gear philosophy.

```Favor the generic over the specialized.```
