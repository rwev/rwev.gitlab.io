<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
The rationale behind the crazy idea of living a semi-mobile life in a metal tube with an engine after it would've otherwise ended up in a scrapyard.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Our decision to purchase a skoolie was driven by views we share in our friend community on the modern specialized economy.

Weeding out the delicacy of
a specialized career, instead favoring the freedom, self-sufficiency, robustness,
and resiliency of self enterprise.

We've even expressed interest in becoming
part of a bartering commune, in which everyone brings their full set of skills
to the table... more on that later.
