Title: The Rationale of Body Armor

Body armor often gets a bad wrap. It has a reputation of being an impractical obsession of "gun nuts", the crazies and kooks, the unstable conspiracy theorist types. 

Hacking through the weeds, there is more to body armor, and I think it makes more sense than most deliberate law-abiding citizens consider.

## The Defensive Side of the Equation

Seeking to preserve life, rather than taking it. It is peaceful and passive. 

It's completely legal. It is protection from abuse of our freedoms and the accidents of users of the power tools.

By owning a defensive firearm, one is acknowledging the possibility of acting defensively with lethal force. Given that acceptance, why then is protecting oneself from the threat with armor such so crazy? I don't think it is at all.   

## The System

Lots of options. 

Realistically most threats (as ooutlined in tac sys post) will be within X yards, and furthermore, pistol rounds, and mroe likely that not a 9mm or 45. Both of which this system can stop, at a fraction of the cost and weight of a stop-anything system.
Level IIIA will stop all pistols threats up to .44 mag, and additional, and obviously, the ubiquitous .22lr.


Soft armor fits to the body and flexes with movement, more afford

DKX IIIA standlone plate - simplicity no need to integrate soft offer + trauma plate, full 20oz; shooters cut 18oz. Weighs less.

Everything is tradeoff, again. You can stop anything with enough weight and expense. But get realistic.
