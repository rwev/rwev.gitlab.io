Title: Free Trade's Hidden Devils

Free trade, and it's globalism grandfather, is lauded without consent - praised as offering mutually benefits for both sides: jobs in the land of production, cheaper costs in the land of consumption. It is hailed as economic progress, and pursued without relent as the means to the have-it-all end. 

One can't argue with that. Free trade delivers (literally, billions) of tons of goods to the West each year. 

If economics and increased material quality of life is gained, what is the opportunity cost with free trade and globalism? Certainly something must be, if we are to hold economics to its own principles.

## Loss of Localized Production Knowledge

## Loss of Tangible Skills

## Loss of Simple Livelihood

## Loss of the Self-made Fulfillment

## Loss of Economic Independence

This is just what happens in the "land of consumption." But as a globally-conscious citizen, what are the repercussions in the production lands? Free trade skepticism is often written off as nationalism or patriotism, even moreso since Trump. 

Foreign production does indeed offer better jobs to the peoples of less-developed lands. But everything is relative. Those jobs do often pay better than domestic opportunities, but in comparison with Western labor markets, the conditions are often drastically unsafe. 

Cheap foreign production, if measure it on the ruler of Western labor practices, is a result of _exploitation_. Sure, the foreign workers may voluntarily produce at the demand of the West, but often out of desperation. The workers certainly don't reap the same benefits and quality of life for their labor as we do in the west. 

So, import taxes and tariffs aren't just protectionist and isolation, but the decentivize / discourage this exploitation. The fines change the profit and loss equation of outsourcing / offshoring production. Continued offshore production can then be reallocated to address the externalities and negative consequences of globalist free trade - by providing foreign development aid or to retrain workers in "consumption" countries where jobs are lost in the effort to restructure labor market and pivot into .
