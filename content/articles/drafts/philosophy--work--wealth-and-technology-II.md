This post is part two of the analysis of Paul Graham's essays that address the interconnection of wealth creation and technological development. Specifically, in this post, we look at [Mind the Gap](www.paulgraham.com/gap.html), another essay contained in his collection _Hackers & Painters._

Mr. Graham begins by pointing out the that money-making is a skill, liking writing, or designing, or hospitality. However, money-making, or rather money-makers, are treated differently than writers or designers or relations people.

He identifies the cause of this intellectual inconsistency as the narrative, handed down through the generations, that money is only made (gained) at the expense of another, or the broader society.

> [We perpetuate] the misleading model of wealth we learn as children; the disreputable way in which, till recently, most fortunes were accumulated; and the worry that great variations in income are somehow bad for society. As far as I can tell, the first is mistaken, the second outdated, and the third empirically false.


He proposes thereafter a radically different contrarian approach to thinking about divisions of wealth.

> Could it be that, in a modern democracy, variation in income is actually a sign of health.


### Understanding Wealth

In order to begin to understand a wild, unconventional hypothesis, we must have the same concepts of wealth, and how it is differentiated from money.
> Wealth is not money. Money is just a convenient way of trading one form of wealth for another.

Wealth can and is created independently from money. Money is the socially-accepted means to transfer wealth.

> We create wealth for other people in exchange for money, which we then trade for the forms of wealth we want.

Money transfers, although broadly driven by the creation of wealth by the receiver through work and invention, does not have to be. The government generally redistributes wealth from those who are strong wealth producers to those who are economically weaker.

Independent of morally proper welfare systems, whether driven by the state or organized citizens,

> In the real world, wealth is (except for a few specialists like thieves, speculators, regulatory arbitrageurs) something you have to create, not something that’s distributed by Daddy.

And naturally, some people are better are creating wealth (an activity closely related to money-making), than others, just as some people are better at mathematics or piano playing, whether by natural ability or diligent training. This brings us to the "root cause of the variation of income", which to the dismay of many, doesn't lie with corrupt social structures:

> The root cause of variation in income, as <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's Razor</a> implies, is the same as the root cause of variation in every other human skill.

People make money by doing what other people want. With surprisingly few exceptions,

> Those who make more money are often simply better at doing what people want.

### Technology, the Great Lever of Productivity

Technology, as a magnifier or multiplier of productivity, widens the gap between the unproductive and the productive. In the era of technology, one must constantly adapt to the extension to productivity that technology provides, or risk getting left behind.

> In ancient Rome the price of slaves varied by a factor of 50 depending on their skills. And that’s without considering motivation, or the extra leverage in productivity that you can get from modern technology... With a tractor an energetic farmer could plow six times as much land in a day as he could with a team of horses. *But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.*

Technology doesn't increase the gap between rich and poor, per say, but rather between the productive and the unproductive, which are closely related in the presence of a well-functioning and non-corrupt political and economic system.

### Capitalism and Democracy

Capitalism, and the free markets that it entails, are much like a democracy. In a competitive market, buyers are able to decide what they want, and empower those who do the better job at provide it through their purchases. What does this mean for the wages received for labor?

> In a free market, prices [like supply] are determined by what buyers want.i

The flaw with the market is identical with those of the democracy:

> Well, of course people want the wrong things.

Thus, the concept of under-compensation isn't a problem inherent to the capitalistic system, but rather the people who drive it by voting with their dollars.

Thus people receive to the extent that they meet the needs and demands of their counterparts. To the extent that people fairly accomplish this,

> Income varies simply according to how much wealth people create, the distribution may be unequal, but it’s hardly unjust.

Income discrepancies are fair. You reap what you sow.

### Widening Relative Gaps, Closing Absolute Gaps

Should we be worried about the growing productivity gaps, and the wealth gaps than follow? Paul doesn't think so:

> Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to decrease other gaps. A hundred years ago, the rich led a different kind of life from ordinary people. They lived in houses full of servants, wore elaborately uncomfortable clothes, and traveled about in carriages drawn by teams of horses which themselves required their own houses and servants. Now, thanks to technology, the rich live more like the average person....
        the rich spend their time more like everyone else too... materially and socially, technology seems to be decreasing the gap between the rich and the poor, not increasing it… Is it a problem if technology increases that gap? It doesn’t seem to be so far. As it increases the gap in income, it seems to decrease most other gaps... if I had a choice of living in a society where I was materially much better off than I am now, but was among the poorest, or in one where I was the richest, but much worse off than I am now, I’d take the first option… It’s absolute poverty you want to avoid, not relative poverty.

### Branding: A Symptom of the Dying Lifestyle Gap

> The only thing technology can’t cheapen is brand. Which is precisely why we hear ever more about it. Brand is the residue left as the substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate… Now even the poorest Americans drive cars, and it is only because we’re so well trained by advertising that we can even recognize the especially expensive ones.

### Technology as the Driver of the Competitive Market System

> The same pattern has played out in industry after industry. If there is enough demand for something, technology will make it cheap enough to sell in large volumes, and the mass-produced versions will be, if not better, at least more convenient… It’s inconvenient to do something expensive and custom [what the rich want].

### Setting Up the System
> This started to change in Europe with the rise of the middle class. Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor poor, but originally they were a distinct group. In a feudal society, there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the serfs who work their estates. The middle class were a new, third group who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing and trade... the middle class made a living largely by creating wealth... but unlike serfs they had an incentive to create a lot of it. Any wealth a serf created belonged to his master. There was not much point in making more than you could hide. Whereas the independence of the townsmen allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created... nearly everything we have was created by the middle class. Indeed, the other two classes have effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and their names been given to either end of the middle class...but it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation definitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich...seventeenth-century England was much like the third world today, in that government office was a recognized route to wealth. The great fortunes of that time still derived more from what we would now call corruption than from commerce. By the nineteenth century that had changed. There continued to be bribes, as there still are everywhere, but politics had by then been left to men who were driven more by vanity than greed. Technology had made it possible to create wealth faster than you could steal it. The prototypical rich man of the nineteenth century was not a courtier but an industrialist... with the rise of the middle class, wealth stopped being a zero-sum game... only a few countries (by no coincidence, the richest ones) have reached this stage. In most, corruption still has the upper hand. In most, the fastest way to get wealth is by stealing it.

The rich people of today didn't make us poor. They've made and are making us wealthier. This must be true: we paid them with our free-willed spending in our [imperfect] competitive market economy, because we perceived whatever they were selling as an improvement to our lives, for better or for worse.

It follows that we should revere the present and future rich in our society, as long as they got their honestly. We need rich people _not _because they will invest and create jobs, as the trickle down narrative, but because they improve our lives.

> You need rich people in your society not so much because in spending their money they create jobs, but because of what they have to do to get rich. I’m not talking about the trickle-down effect here. I’m not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he’ll hire you as a waiter at his next party. I’m saying that he’ll make you a tractor to replace your horse.

### The Implication of the Opposite Tendency

What if the income differential was decreasing? What would this mean for the way society is functioning? Although it seems like a noble goal, what does this condition imply?

> If we don’t see corresponding variation in income, there are three possible explanations:
    <ol>
        <li>that technical innovation has stopped,</li>
        <li>that the people who would create the most wealth aren’t doing it, or</li>
        <li>that they aren’t getting paid for it.</li>
    </ol>

Thus, we arrive at the conclusion that

> increasing variation in income is a sign of health.

But is it possible any other way?

> Will people create wealth if they can’t get paid for it?
    <br>
    Only if it’s fun.

    People will write operating systems for free. But they won’t install them, or take support calls, or train customers to use them. And at least 90% of the work that even the highest tech companies do is of this second, unedifying kind.
