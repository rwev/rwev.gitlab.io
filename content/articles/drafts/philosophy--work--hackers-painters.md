Tags: code,art,design,process

This post is a summary of the my takeaways  from Paul Graham's book, _Hackers and Painters, _a collection of his essays on technology and the modern economy, and named after the second essay of the collection of the same name.

## Hackers & Painters

The headliner of the collection. The quotes are not presented in the same order as the text; I've grouped them by idea.

<div class="quote">
    Hackers and painters are both makers.
</div>
Occupations share more in common than what meets the eye. Whenever someone says they work in technology, many seem amazed, as if they are a whole different level of human. This is false. The average blue-collar strong-armed construction contractor has more in common with the average white-collar weak-armed programmer than meets the eye. _All professionals want to make good things_.

### Hacking Profitably

<div class="quote">
    What and how should not be kept too separate.
</div>

Knowing what to make is key to knowing how to make it. Any division taints the purity of the solution realization process, and levels of communication slow it down. Be both the architect and the engineer.

<div class="quote">
    The way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle tweaks to something that already exists, or to combine existing ideas in a slightly new way...
    Big companies want to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes because they want to avoid disasters.
</div>

They do this by separating design and implementation. Product managers write the specifications that the engineers code up. Nothing exceptional can be developed in this layout. The inspiration and experimentation of the hacker, which drives innovation, is quelled.

<div class="quote">
    Fight design wars is in new markets, where no one has yet managed to establish any fortifications.
</div>

The industry behemoths, which continues to separate why and how, will churn out lower quality solutions in a longer period of time than an agile startup with the hacker mindset. Fight on open ground, where consumer product recognition and a marketing ecosystem don't yet exist.

<div class="quote">
    There is not much overlap between the kind of software that makes money and the kind that’s interesting to write.
</div>

Until you find a sweet spot, an area of overlap, keep a day job, and write interesting software in your down time. Get involved in the open-source community.

<div class="quote">
    You can’t do anything really well unless you love it, and if you love to hack you’ll
inevitably be working on projects of your own.
</div>

### What Hackers Can Learn From Painters

<div class="quote">
    Computers are just a medium of expression, as paint for painters...  Hackers need to understand the theory of computation about as much as painters need to understand paint chemistry.
</div>

Just as the driver of the car doesn't need to know everything behind its function (electrical control systems or the science of combustion) to be competent on the roads, a hacker doesn't need to know the theory behind why an algorithm works or how machine code runs on a processor. It's possible to have full control of one's realm without universal knowledge of the theoretical abstraction that surrounds or involves it.

<div class="quote">
    Spew out code... and gradually beat it into shape.... figure out programs as you’re writing them, just as writers and painters and architects do... Paintings are created by gradual refinement. Paintings usually begin with a sketch.
</div>

Just as other other creators sketch, programmers should sketch too. Painters don't expect all lines to be perfect the first time they draw them. Likewise, hackers shouldn't expect the design to stay static through implementation. Develop in a way that recognizes and embraces this as a key to a beautiful final product.

<div class="quote">
    You learn to paint mostly by doing it. Ditto for hacking.   
</div>

Painters aren't made great (entirely) because they are born painters -- it's because they paint a lot. The 10,000 hour rule holds in a surprising number of industries and occupations.

<div class="quote">
    Painters leave a trail of work behind them, you can watch them learn by doing.
</div>

Paul points out that it is possible to see a chronological escalation of painting quality as time goes on. Techniques are tried and improved upon from one work to the next.

<div class="quote">
    Maybe it would be good for hackers to act more like painters, and regularly start over from scratch, instead of continuing to work for years on one project.
</div>

Free innovation and creative thinking by letting it loose on a clean slate. Don't let the failures or exclusions of the past be a burden on ascent of the project

<div class="quote">
    Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to beauty. If you look inside good software, you find that parts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too. When it comes to code I behave in a way that would make me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way. It drives me crazy to see code that’s badly indented, or that uses ugly variable names.
</div>

Paul and I have the same behavior here. I once had a coworker who became annoyed when I would format code such that it was spaced and tabbed in a predictable, constant pattern, and rename variables so that they made sense in their usage context. My coworker even went as far to suggest I should get checked up for obsessive-compulsive disorder, as if my drive to seek order was a problem to be resolved and done away with.

Although some of the changes I made that annoyed may coworker probably _were_ over-the-top, my boss, a career programmer and owner of the business, quickly came to compliment. He said that he loved my attention to detail, and in the high-risk field of trading software, where any given bug could result in significant financial loss, it was absolutely critical.

The same boss also imparted another career altering mentality. While recognizing the concept of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) (in our case, more Minimum Viable Features were developed), he wanted to _write code for the decades. _It's okay to write short, concise programs, but make them modular, expandable, and reusable. This means writing code in such a structure that it, in painting terminology, can be re-sketched and filled-in.

<div class="quote">
    In hacking, like painting, work comes in cycles.
</div>

The maker should take the cyclical nature of inspiration into account. Don't burn yourself out in period of intense inspiration; don't stall in periods of inspirational drought. One can manage this by recognizing

<div class="quote">
    In both painting and hacking there are some tasks that are terrifyingly ambitious, and others that are comfortingly routine.
</div>

Save the routine tasks (such as debugging) for times of low inspiration, so that when it comes, the ambitious and creative tasks can be accomplished by riding the wave of high inspiration.

<div class="quote">
    When painters worked together on a painting, they never worked on the same parts.
</div>

Paul suggests that this is the correct model for programming in a team, and sharing a code base. Define the project into "sharply defined modules, each with a definite owner." When there is no one principally responsible for a section of code, it tends to be neglected, a sort of reversed "tragedy of the commons" in which too few do too little properly.

<div class="quote">
    Hackers, like painters, must have empathy [for the human audience] to do really great work... looking at things from other people’s point of view is practically the secret of success.
</div>

Empathy is defined as the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. To make things that are loved and admired by the audience (or in technology, users), one must cater to their desires.

<div class="quote">
    To write good software you have to understand how little users understand.
</div>

Good design is self-explanatory and easy to interpret.

### Makers and Intellectual Endurance

<div class="quote">
    There is no correlation, except possibly a negative one, between people’s ability to recognize good design and their confidence that they can.
</div>

Hackers, like artists, are purveyors of good design. Lack of credit for good design may be no fault of the hacker or the artist, but rather the judge. But there is a small degree of consolation in the fact that

<div class="quote">
    The only external test is time. Over time, beautiful things tend to thrive, and ugly things tend to get discarded.
</div>

Just as painters are writers sometimes become magnitudes more famous after their time has passed, so it can be with the work of hackers. It can take centuries for good design to be recognized. Therefore,

<div class="quote">
    Hackers just have to resign themselves to having a large
random component in their reputations.
</div>

This goes to say that makers must to accept the risk that their work, no matter how absolutely good on the scale of centuries, may never be recognized in their time. Like in many fields,

<div class="quote">
    There is always a big time lag in prestige. It’s like light from a distant star. Painting has prestige now because of great work people did five hundred years ago.
</div>

The glory days of painting weren't glory days in their time. Painters in their times were often perceived by their countrymen as obscure and their work inconsequential, and possibly even psychotic.

<div class="quote">
    In most fields the great work is done early on. The paintings made between 1430 and 1500 are still unsurpassed... [When] a new medium appears, people are so excited about it that they explore most of its possibilities in the first couple generations.
</div>

Are the glory days of technology already over? It's only been a couple generations, so it's hard to tell.

## What You Can't Say
Essay #3 in the collection.

Paul explains how just as there are fashions in clothing, music, and other superficial products of the modern economy, there are_ moral_ fashions.

<div class="quote">
    If you could travel back in a time machine, one thing would be true no matter where you went: you’d have to watch what you said.
   
  </div>
Statements we consider as basic fact today were at some point in time heretical and blasphemous (examples to follow). In more cases than not, such revolutionary (looking from our time, not theirs) claims were made by, what we would consider today, nerds.

<div class="quote">
    Nerds are always getting in trouble. They say improper things
for the same reason they dress unfashionably and have good ideas.
Convention has less hold over them.</div>
Innovators of the past had to fight against popular opinion to reveal scientific truths, we have to do the same today. Unfortunately, in our modern era, just like _every other era in history,_ people like to think that we are not vulnerable to such ignorance and blinded by our own fashions.

<div class="quote">
    It would be a remarkable coincidence if ours were the first era to get everything just right.
</div>
#### Fashions

<div class="quote">
    Fashion is mistaken for good design; moral fashion is mistaken for good.
</div>

Fashions (_def.: a popular or the latest style) _all all kinds are random, and unrecognizable to most people, as most people are not cognizant of the trends of the past. However,

<div class="quote">
    [Violating clothing fashions] gets you laughed at. Violating moral fashions can get you fired, ostracized, imprisoned, or even killed.
</div>

Paul then outlines several methods to objectively identify whether you or any given individual is following moral fashion.

#### Identifying Fashion-Following: _The Conformist Test_

<div class="quote">
    Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of a group of your peers?
</div>

If yes, congratulations. You're likely not a conformist by willing to recognize, however unpopular it is to do so, that the popular moral environment contains errors.

If no, then you effectively believe everything the popular wave wants you to. At this point, there are two possible explanations.

<div class="quote">
    Odds are you just think whatever you’re told.
</div>

They less likely explanation is that

<div class="quote">
    You independently considered every question and came up with the exact same answers that are now considered acceptable.
</div>

Because the societal consensus moral map contains mistakes, just like any other era of history, any individual makes the same mistakes in the moral map out of happenstance isn't convincing: just like a copied geographical map will contain the same intentional mistakes that were planted there by the original cartographer.

#### Identifying Fashion-Following: _The Trouble Test_

Another way we can identify fashions is to look at what someone can do to get laughed at or even ostracized. _What we can't say_ is a often a product of the moral map society is following at the tie.

<div class="quote">
    Keep track of opinions that get people in trouble, and start asking, could this be true? Ok, it may be heretical (or whatever modern equivalent), but might it also be true?
</div>

Obviously true or obviously false statements or ideas don't get people in trouble. Statements on the edge do: statements that _set questioning into movement. _They are not obviously true or false, but rather require further consideration.

#### Identifying Fashion-Following: _The Heresy Test_
For this test of fashion following, look for the_ application of labels _as a method of dismissal for provocative thought.

<div class="quote">
    In every period of history, there seem to have been labels that got applied to statements to shoot them down before anyone had a chance to ask if they were true or not.
</div>

This is particularly useful in the "Identity Politics" of the recent American elections (2016).

<div class="quote">
    In any period, it should be easy to figure out what such labels are, simply by looking at what people call ideas they disagree with besides untrue. 
    <br> 
    When a politician says his opponent is mistaken, that’s a straightforward criticism, but when he attacks a statement a “divisive” or “racially insensitive” instead of arguing that it’s false, we should start paying attention.
</div>

Applying labels that are a purely plays on what society may find provides emotional and intellectual security are telltale signs of a section of the current moral map may be vulnerable.

<div class="quote">
    If a statement is false, that’s the worst thing you can say about it. You don’t need to say that it’s heretical (i.e. label-and-dismiss it)
</div>

But when you here labels being apply to statements, _ask why_.

#### Identifying Fashion-Following: _The Time & Space Test_

We can look at the changes in society's moral map over time to identify beliefs that can be potential suspects.

<div class="quote">
    Another way to figure out what we’re getting wrong is to look at what used to be acceptable and is now unthinkable.
</div>

I say _suspects_ because of the potential for false positives. In total, society has gotten closer to a more objectively improved moral map. Slavery, for example, was once considered normal, and is now considered unthinkable. But many other changes in popular belief are not as cut-and-dry.

Science is the clearest. The field is always driven closer and closer to the truths of the universe, with no real fluctuation.

<div class="quote">
    In a field like physics, if we disagree with past generations it’s because we’re right and they’re wrong.
</div>

But in politics and popular morality,

<div class="quote">
    Many changes are just fashion. The age of consent fluctuates like hemlines.
</div>

Because morality, however you would think about measuring, fluctuates, instead of climbing (or diving, if you're a pessimist), society cannot possibly always be improving. All societies in the past held views which were wrong; some more than others.

In general, it is arrogant to assume that were remain superior to all societies of history, and are excluded from such error. We must recognize

<div class="quote">
    People in past times were much like us... Whatever their ideas were, they were ideas reasonable people could believe.
</div>

If the scale of time is unable to give you a proper view of the relativism of popular fashion (in the case of a brand new topic or moral theme, the likes of which mankind has never been faced with or considered), you can do it in the moment by

<div class="quote">
    Create[ing] distance yourself. Instead of being part of the mob, stand as far away from it as you can and watch what it’s doing. And pay especially close attention whenever an idea is being suppressed... How can you see the wave, when you’re the water?
</div>

#### The Creation of Moral Fashion

Moral fashions and taboos (the antithesis of fashion) are often generated in connection with power struggles. And the most aggressive and potent struggles for power are carried out by

<div class="quote">
    Groups [that are] poised halfway between weakness and power.
</div>

Nervous and unsettled groups need protection, because they are vulnerable and could quickly fall into frailty. At the same time, the have just enough influence to be able to create and enforce a moral fashion or taboo.

To identify the core moral fashions such groups surround and attempt to guard (with ideological fascism), ask

<div class="quote">
    What groups are powerful but nervous, and what ideas would they like to suppress? What ideas were tarnished by association when they ended up on the losing side of a recent struggle?
</div>

#### Why Care About Fashions

We should care about recognizing moral fashions, or more generally, _intellectual_ fashions or taboos ("the unthinkable") , because

<div class="quote">
    Great work tends to grow out of ideas that others have overlooked, and no idea is so overlooked as one that’s unthinkable.
</div>

Shaky, or in previous terminology, "nervous" ideology is a great target for groundbreaking revolution. Good intellectuals

<div class="quote">
    look for places where conventional wisdom is broken, and then try to pry apart the cracks and see what’s underneath.
</div>

This phenomenon is not just for intellectuals questioning the political or scientific establishment.

<div class="quote">
    In any competitive field, you can win big by seeing things that others daren’t... small trips outside the box [are what] people call innovative.
</div>

#### Living as an Ideological Outsider

It's a service to the progress of society to be an ideological non-conformist and skeptic. How can you live a normal life as one?

<div class="quote">
    Pick your battles... argue with idiots, become an idiot.
</div>

But never stop thinking. Master the ability to _think_ boundlessly and discipline outward expression.

<div class="quote">
    Draw a sharp line between your thoughts and your speech. Inside your head, anything is allowed... Smile at everyone, but don't tell them what you're thinking.
</div>

If pressed for an answer or opinion,

<div class="quote">
    the best policy is to make it plain that you don’t agree with whatever zealotry is current in your time, but not to be too specific about what you disagree with.   
</div>

Chances are, whatever questions people argue intensely over in their time, are more complicated than a "yes or no" or "for or against." Don't cater to the denial of complicated system by giving the crowd of simple and close-minded zealots the simple answer they want.

Another way to avoid personal confrontation and being labelled a heretic is to

<div class="quote">
    Ratchet the debate up one level of abstraction.   
</div>

For example, instead of debating whether some governmental organization should censor some political extremist group, don't get involved in the details of the specific case. Don't feed the bias and give momentum to the popular answer. Instead, discuss censorship in general.
