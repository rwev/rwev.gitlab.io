Title: Rationality

Despite the popular view that faith and rationality are incompatible, the discussion of mind and heart and rationality and emotion carries throughout the Bible. What does the Word have to say about something that it's often convicted of lacking?


*We will lead our hearts or be led by them*

Proverbs TODO

Jesus spoke of heaven _relationally_, not _locationally_.


Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 14 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.
Matthew 7: 13-14

Earth is a close to heaven as one will ever get is Jesus isn't their Lord.


Knowledge != Power. Action on knowledge makes the truth complete. 
We can be sure that we know Him if we obey His teaching. 4 Anyone who says, “I know Him,” but does not obey His teaching is a liar. There is no truth in him. 5 But whoever obeys His Word has the love of God made perfect in him. This is the way to know if you belong to Christ. 6 The one who says he belongs to Christ should live the same kind of life Christ lived.
1 John 2:3-6

You can never keep what isn't yours. God purchased us.

Jesus' command are not exercises of his power or to keep us at bay and from living in fullness -- but to bless us. We have to walk in obedience to receive it. It is _opportunity_ for fullness.
