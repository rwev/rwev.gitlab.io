Title: Brakes
Category: skoolie

Bus was in the shop for 3 days last week.
Shop replaced rear right wheel
cylinder and did some exhaust work. Also cleaned up the treads on the fuel tank
drain. 

Now @brakes hold pressure and bus can be driven more confidently at faster
speeds. It was going to be much more expensive to get all wheel cylinders as well as the
master cylinder replaced, and once I found out that the master cylinder has two
separate pistons, one for front wheels and one for rear, I became less concerned
about the robustness of the system under failure. Both pistons would need to be
compromised, or all four wheel cylinders, in order to lose brakes completely.
Definitely will be cautious and checking fluid level often.  

Still keeping it slow. It's a lot to get used too - not only the size of
vehicle, but also the age. There are fewer bells and whistles, fewer alert
/ feedback systems to keep driver aware. One example - I can't hear the "click"
of the turn signal (could just be the relay) so I have to look in the convex
mirrors on corner of bus to see whether or not signal is flashing. 

Bus is much quieter @exhaust work. Shop replace a section of downpipe from one
side of the engine, and installed donuts to fit exhaust pipes snugly to the engine on both side. Another section with a gas engine was patched with a weld. They didn't fix a tear in the muffler, however, so I'm planning on taking a stab at that myself (maybe JB weld) at some point. Very low priority though, on the long list of things to do. At least one can hold a conversation while engine is running now.
