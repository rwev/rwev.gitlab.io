Title: Out of (Corporate) Office, Forever
Category: philosophy
Tags: spirituality,economics,work,money

After about 18 months working at corporate development shops, I've begun to seriously 
consider it's consequences. 

First is the health aspect. I notice this because on the weekends, my energy level rises immensely to it's peak on Sunday evening. The next morning, within the first few minutes of sitting at my desk, resumes to normal "functioning" work energy. This is probably a consequence of both the lack of physical movement / low metabolism as well as a psychological side effect of the numbing nature of the present engagement. 

"Putting in the time" as opposed to having a personal vested interest in the matter (SITG).
"Doing your job" as opposed to doing something that matters.

        Work destroys your soul by stealthily invading your brain during the hours not officially spend working; be selective about professions.
