Title: Rules for Security & Privacy Account  

## Use Login-less Services.

When possible, the best way to protect your information online is to never hand it out in the first place. There may not be a login-less provider for the service your after (and never will be for some spaces, such as online banking), but it never hurts to [check](https://github.com/fiatjaf/awesome-loginless), 

## No Connected Accounts.

Connecting accounts by logging in to a site with an account from another (e.g. signing into AirBnB or Zillow with your Google or Facebook account) has been a huge trend in recent years. 

Although it may add some level of security by eliminating the need for multiple (usually reused or more crackable) passwords and thus enabling the user to focus on security / a strong password at the central nodes (Google / Facebook), it introduces fragility into the system network of logins: once the central node account is compromised, the whole login network is compromised. 

Using login features like this also expedites data collection and aggregation processes. Instead of potentially having to piece together disparate pieces of information, or being barred from sending data to a third party, the central node services (Google / Facebook) now have the information as part of your account and login process.

The threat goes the other way too. An indiscriminate approval check on an overreaching account permission request can offer your entire life up to whatever third party you've given it to: call history, emails, contacts, calendar events, and location data. 

## No Shared Passwords.

Don't reuse passwords. 

All it takes is one hack of a site or service that mismanages customer data and stores that password in plaintext, and they have the two most critical pieces of information that identify you on the web: your email or username, which you likely also reuse. All they have to do is try that login elsewhere, and they are in. Fortunately, many sites, especially financial ones, are adding device recognition with email verification into their login processes. Hopefully you don't use the same password for your email service too. 


Less convenient, but how often to I log in without autosave passwords, anyway? If one account compromised, then have your email and password, compromising all other accounts. All they have to do is try to log in to related sites with the same info. Once.
- Transition to open source alternatives whenever possible. Try not to remain within the product ecosystem of any one tech concern. Don't let them own you.
- Use Mozilla (Firefox) instead of Chrome, OSM (MAPS.ME) instead of Google Maps. It's okay to continue using selected products from major tech companies, but don't give them combined access. Distribute the dimensions of your life over multiple products and ecosystems. Do open source as much as possible. Diversify.
- This is a gradual process. Set goals. Don't attempt to make the transition over days or weeks. Months are better. Emailing / calling may be necessary to transfer some accounts.
