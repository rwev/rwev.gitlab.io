Key takeaways from the flagship essay in Paul Graham's collection, [_Hackers & Painters_](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html).
> Hackers and painters are both makers.

Whenever one says they work in technology, many layman seem amazed, as if they are a whole different level of human. In reality, the average blue-collar strong-armed construction contractor has more in common with the average white-collar weak-armed programmer than meets the eye. 

_All professionals want to make good things_: here's what they do to achieve that. 

## Bottom-Up, not Top-Down

Know what to make is key to knowing how to make it. Any division taints the purity of the solution realization process, and hierarchies of communication slow it down. 

Be both the architect and the engineer. Be versatile and maintain a high level of vision, mindful of interconnectedness and interdependence.  

> What and how should not be kept too separate.
    <br><br>
    The way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle tweaks to something that already exists, or to combine existing ideas in a slightly new way.
    
But this is not the preferred approach of heavy and bureaucratic organizations. They want structure, predictability, and every degree of management possible.  
> Big companies want to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes because they want to avoid disasters.

They do this by separating design and implementation. Product managers write the specifications that the engineers code up. Nothing exceptional can be developed in this layout. The inspiration and experimentation of the hacker, which drives innovation, is quelled.
> Fight design wars is in new markets, where no one has yet managed to establish any fortifications.

The industry behemoths, which separate why and how, will churn out lower quality solutions in a longer period of time than an agile startup with the hacker mindset. Fight on open ground, where consumer product recognition and a marketing ecosystem don't yet exist: where creativity and bottom-up approaches can thrive.
> There is not much overlap between the kind of software that makes money and the kind that’s interesting to write.

Until you find a sweet spot, an area of overlap, keep a day job, and write interesting software in your down time. Get involved in the open-source community.
> You can’t do anything really well unless you love it, and if you love to hack you’ll inevitably be working on projects of your own.

## What Hackers Can Learn From Painters

There are strong parallels between the hacking and painting communities in their creativity, design, and implementation processes.
 
### On The Frontline
It is hard to make, create, or otherwise add novel value when one is bogged down in low-level technical details.
 
Do not be hesitant to "stand on the shoulders of giants" and utilize the work of those who came before, and leveraging it to build the pyramid higher. Learn from and use the wisdom of history. Leave solved problems in the past; take the advantage of solutions into the future. Don't reinvent the wheel, use it.
 
> Computers are just a medium of expression, as paint for painters...  Hackers need to understand the theory of computation about as much as painters need to understand paint chemistry.

Just as the driver of the car doesn't need to know everything behind its function (electrical control systems or the science of combustion) to be competent on the roads, a hacker doesn't need to know the theory behind why an algorithm works or how machine code runs on a processor. It's possible to have full control of one's realm without universal knowledge of the theoretical abstraction that surrounds or involves it.

Stay on the frontline, at the peak of abstraction, where the power of leverage is at its highest and field of view (vision) at its widest. 

### Sketch and Prototype
> Spew out code... and gradually beat it into shape.... figure out programs as you’re writing them, just as writers and painters and architects do... Paintings are created by gradual refinement. Paintings usually begin with a sketch.

Just as other other creators sketch, programmers should sketch too. Painters don't expect all lines to be perfect the first time they draw them. Likewise, hackers shouldn't expect the design to stay static through implementation. Develop in a way that recognizes and embraces this as a key to a beautiful final product.
> You learn to paint mostly by doing it. Ditto for hacking.   

Painters aren't made great (entirely) because they are born painters -- it's because they paint a lot.
> Painters leave a trail of work behind them, you can watch them learn by doing.

Paul points out that it is possible to see a chronological escalation of painting quality as time goes on. Techniques are tried and improved upon from one work to the next.
> Maybe it would be good for hackers to act more like painters, and regularly start over from scratch, instead of continuing to work for years on one project.

Free innovation and creative thinking by letting it loose on a clean slate. Don't let the failures or exclusions of the past be a burden on ascent of the project.
> Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to beauty. If you look inside good software, you find that parts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too. When it comes to code I behave in a way that would make me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way. It drives me crazy to see code that’s badly indented, or that uses ugly variable names.

### Ride the Cycle
> In hacking, like painting, work comes in cycles.
>
The maker should take the cyclical nature of inspiration into account. Don't burn yourself out in period of intense inspiration; don't stall in periods of inspirational drought. One can manage this by recognizing
> In both painting and hacking there are some tasks that are terrifyingly ambitious, and others that are comfortingly routine.

Save the routine tasks (such as debugging) for times of low inspiration, so that when it comes, the ambitious and creative tasks can be accomplished by riding the wave of high inspiration.
> When painters worked together on a painting, they never worked on the same parts.
>
Paul suggests that this is the correct model for programming in a team, and sharing a code base. Define the project into "sharply defined modules, each with a definite owner." 

When there is no one principally responsible for a section of code, it tends to be neglected, a sort of reversed "tragedy of the commons" in which too few do too little properly.


### Empathetic Design 

> Hackers, like painters, must have empathy [for the human audience] to do really great work... looking at things from other people’s point of view is practically the secret of success.

Empathy is defined as the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. To make things that are loved and admired by the audience (or in technology, users), one must cater to their desires.
> To write good software you have to understand how little users understand.

Good design is empathetic, self-explanatory and easy to interpret, respectful and aware of the both the abilities and desires of the user or audience.
