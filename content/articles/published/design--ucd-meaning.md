With the concept of user-centered design becoming a buzzword among technology inspired groups, the original meaning becomes ambiguous, like a game of telephone in which each subsequent relay redefines the term in order to sound cooler and more in tune with Silicon Valley culture and popular street talk alike.

Here's what _user-centered design_ actually means.

### Defining User-Centered Design

The concept was first defined by Norman and Draper (1) in 1986:

> User-centered design emphasizes that the purpose of the system is to serve the user, not to use a specific technology, not to be an elegant piece of programming. The needs of the users should dominate the design of the interface, and the needs of the interface should dominate the design of the rest of the system.

While "traditional" software engineering places emphasis on the functional aspects of software systems (the back end architecture), user-centered design concentrates on the user.

UCD makes more business sense. Software exists for the sole person of serving users, thus the value it adds to the world is derived from how well it achieves that, not on _how_ it achieves it (using a particular programming language or architecture).

Code in and of itself does not generate wealth. Code that meets the needs of users does. Software businesses are not in the business of writing code -- they are in the business of serving users, and they deliver such service using code as a means.

For a system to be successful, it must be

- useful,
- usable,
- used.

If a system is designed around the users, it will have a greater likelihood of achieving these criteria. The success of any software system is determined _by the users_, and _not by the programming gods_. That is to say, writing elegant code for the sake of elegant code doesn't pay.

User-centered design has also been called _usability engineering_, or software engineering concentration on usability, rather than functionality.

Nielsen (2) defined usability in 1994:

- efficiency → resources expenditure and task completion are bound.
- satisfaction → product usage and happiness are bound.
- learnability → the product's learning curve should be steep (when usage ability is dependent on experience)
- memorability → system should be easy to pick up and put down without repeating expensive learning investment;  aided by product simplicity
- errors → system should robustly handle mistakes made by the user; minimization of harmful consequences

It is clear that these factors are intertwined; the ability of the system to resolve user error without stimulating frustration will affect how satisfied the user is.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) offers a second definition (ISO 9241):

> Usability: the extent to which a product can be used by specified _users_
to achieve specified goals with effectiveness and efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.


Users, goals, and context of use influence the design process.

Effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction are each measures of how usable the product is, or otherwise how well the design process was carried out.

### Minding the Gap

The maximization of each of these measures in design is, in aggregate, the minimization the design-use gap. 

The design-use gap is the deviation (discrepancy) between the developer's goals and the user's goals, correspondingly, between how the developer expects his / her product to be used, vs. how it actually is used.

It's the job of the _developer_ to close this gap. Yes, it's possible for user education to artificially narrow this gap, but as discussed before, products with great usability theoretical require minimal education. Products that narrow this gap without demands from the user will outperform in a market offering choice.

### Allocation of Function

User-centered design entails a logical allocation of functionality performance to the users and to the designed system (ISO 13407).

This allocation answers _what should the users do, and what should our product do_? In other words, what should not be performed by the system and instead should be left to the user.

In the age of technology, it is tempting to automate everything. Its assumed that if something _can_ be automated, it _should _be automated. User-centered design therefore questions this assumption.

Automation of non-trivial tasks can yield uncomfortable unpredictability, or puts the users in situations where he or she doesn't know exactly how the system will perform.
