Title: The Case of Craigslist

Craigslist is an increasingly rare breed of internet organization, exemplifying purity of design, empowering democracy and equity, and valuing principle greater than profit. 

The simplicity of the design mean a well-understood codebase, and a design team that has likely remained vigilant against feature creep and the abstained temptation to rebuild the site in the latest front-end facade or patterned server framework. The product and its track record demonstrate Unix-style [discipline](http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html#id2877610) and [humility](http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html#id2877917). The site is functional, and fast: devoid of loading screens and spinners, as primitive a heuristic this may be.
 
As positive side effects of simplicity, the site is learnable and memorable. When an interface barely changes since debut, those usability characteristics come for free. Nowadays one might call the design _timeless_, ignorant to fashion. It does not overwhelm the user with relentless interface changes, but instead has kept a raw HTML appearance since its founding decades ago, while virtually the rest of the internet has followed the herd into over-stimulating and under-performant appearance. Craiglist's steadfastness to purpose & principle, independently of profit, is unparalleled by any other household internet name. 
  
Craigslist respects its multi-generational userbase, a group people who want to simply want to communicate with the regional public for exchange of goods, services, jobs, romance, rentals, meetups, with a minimal amount of overhead, whether mental or financial.  Constant redesign for non-functionality would conflict with their interests.
   
 This loyalty to users is returned in kind. Perhaps most telling, Craigslist does no marketing of itself. Instead, the organization has built a reputation preceding it throughout its growth. The platform and value it provides speaks for itself so succinctly, and louder than words. 
    
> Craigslist is a bit of an anomaly on the rapidly changing Internet. While other sites are constantly tweaking, testing new designs, finding new ways to gather data, Craigslist is remarkable for its stability. <br><br> [They] believe in keeping the design as simple and functional as possible. <br><br>
[I]t's never had a competitor that was really able to swallow up its user base. It's had loyal customers all along, loyal users all along, so it's just never been forced to adapt. <br><br>Craigslist doesn't run banner ads [and] doesn't sell user data to third parties. <br><br> Craigslist is also different for being anonymous... [and] is part of the poor people's Internet [where] you don't have to worry about people discriminating against you [because you're anonymous]. <p class="annotation"><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/02/24/808965078/at-25-years-understanding-the-longevity-of-Craigslist">At 25 Years, Understanding The Longevity Of Craigslist</a></p> 
   
In an age where the reputation of the internet continues to become deeply tainted by profit- and power-driven pursuits of advertising, divisive politics, and surveillance, Craigslist has remained a pillar of the original internet ideal: unifying, utilitarian, and (data-)unconditional. It
 has upheld libertarian-like principles of internet utopia, putting people and privacy above monetization-first business models behind modern big-internet business. Its uniquely private ownership allows the site to put principle before profit.
