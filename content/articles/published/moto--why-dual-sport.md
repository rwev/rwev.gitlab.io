Title: Why Dual Sport

To some, dual sport motorcycles represent an ugly middle ground between on-road and off-road riding: a jack of both trades, master of neither. 

That may be true. They can't go everywhere a dirt bike can, nor can they cruise as fast or as comfortably as a street bike. Usually single-cylinder four-strokes, they don't have quite to lightweight performance or agility of a dirt bike, or the raw straight-line power of a multi-cylinder highway cruiser. They don't have the forgiving deep suspension travel of a dirt bike, nor the smoothness of a street bike. 

But this versatility, however comprimising, is exactly what I love about dual sport.

No trailering, no separate bikes for separate riding types. 

Only one bike to know, to fix, to maintain. One bike to know deeply, figure out its quirks and individual needs. One bike to insure. One bike that can take you almost anywhere.

There's no vehicle on the planet as versatile. It can take you up the roughest mountain trails, which no side-by-side or jeep could conquer, yet still cruise at highway speed limits. 

It is not the best at any _one_ thing. But it can do everything, and very cost effectively. This is what I love about dual sport. A reflection of my affinity for the versatile and adaptable as a type seven.
