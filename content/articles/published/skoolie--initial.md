We took delivery of our long-converted International School Bus, Sunday 06/24/2019.

Delma, as she is affectionately named, is a 1979 SV International S1723 body and 1982 International 6.4L 392cid V8. She got her RV title decades ago.

We are parking it a at nearly RV storage place near the airport in Boise, Idaho.

We did a few hours worth of work on it right away.

- Reattached the driveshaft. The tow truck hauled the bus illegally without
a permit (which explains why they delivered early on a Sunday morning, when the
DOT wasn't out). Our delivery was a sketchy side deal so we had to do this ourselves.
It was a pain getting it back on. We lost a needle bearing and some grease. May
need to checking up on the bearings later.
- Checkup on the coolant system. Need to bring more water to site. Radiator is
bone dry after six or seven years without being driven.
- Remounted the rear left window. Took a lot of silicon lube to slide the rubber
seal back around the metal frame.
- Ran the engine periodically. Without any coolant in the system it overheated
after a couple minutes. The bus will now stay running and level without any choke or
throttle assistance.
- Flush the brake lines. The master reservoir was also bone dry upon arrival. We
were able to get pressure from new fluid to all of the wheel cylinders. First time bleeding the brakes led to a fluid explosion. Too much pressure built
up with the valve too far open. We lost a bottle of fluid into the engine bay,
onto the ground, and spray on her face.
- Tried to figure out the exhaust situation. Their is a very long and wide gash
in the right downpipe. Will need to take to exhaust shop.
- Filled the radiator (took probably 4 gallons of water to start) 
- Changed the oil. Put in 10 quart of Shell Rotella 15W-40. Installed new Wix air and oil filters.

Our theory with purchasing this particularly bus was as follows. 

It's an old bus, and there is little certainty about what actually works. 

Mechanical drive, engine, transmission? Not sure. Alignment issues or frame damage? Unknown. Tires? Questionable. Propane tanks, sealed? Refrigerator that refrigerates? Water pump? Fresh and black water tanks? Auxiliary battery? Insulation? 

While there is very little that we _know_, we have confidence in the _system_. There are lots of signs that show competency of the initial builder. The cabinetry and framing is wonderfully done and has held up for the better part of twenty years and is still rock-solid. 

The design of each system seems well thought out and intentional. The mounting of large items, such as the propane tanks, water heater, refrigerator, black water tanks are sturdy, safe. The fact that they put the fresh water tanks in the bed box was smart - that room is heated with the bodies of occupants as well as any additional heating element overnight, keeping the water from freezing. Lots of different things that were simply done right. 

That said, the components in each of these systems are in questionable state. However, the _system_ itself has been used, the quirks ironed out over years of occupancy and continuous improvement. Designing the system was, in our minds, the toughest part of doing a build ourselves, as it involves tons of trial and error following hours of planning on design. Replacing the components of a system is very easy and straightforward compared with starting from the ground up. 

More generally, the value we saw in the bus was not in it's components or in its working state. It was in the design, the systems, the _potential_ of a working unit.

Lots of questions - very overwhelming at first. 

School bus conversions, like an niche, unique, custom-built product, have a limited market. The most unsettling condition of the purchase is _not knowing_ the value. Did I just vastly overpay or was it a steal? Impossible to know. Unlike the market for anything mass produced, say a Toyota Camry, there isn't a huge, liquid market out there confirming the value of possessions - there is no crowd-validation of worth. In this case, worth is in the eyes of the beholder.
