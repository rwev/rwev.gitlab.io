There are lots of common justifications for outsourcing work. Whether it is repairs, upkeep, installations, upgrades, diagnostics, and essentially anything else under the sun that could be considered laborious, we've all heard these reasons and likely given them as in excuse not to do-it-ourselves.

After further consideration of these reasons, I've put some thought into debunking them, or otherwise developing a system of thought around why one should _not_ let these obstacles of thought block them from do-it-yourself pursuits.

## Mental Obstacles 

Many of the following attempted justifications why one would not do-it-themselves are closely related - they all boil in one way or another down to time and effort. I've tried to partition them as cleanly as possible, but there is some overlap and repetition of thought. Call it _beating a dead horse_.

### "I don't know how"

With the growth of the modern specialized economy, people don't generally hold a quiver of proficiencies quite like previous generations. Intellectual jurisdictions become increasingly narrower with each leap of economic "progress".

I think this tendency is worth resisting. _Not knowing is in itself a justification for learning._ Even if is a task that won't need to be performed very often - such a changing a starter motor in an SUV - there is a lot of knowledge, problem-solving, and dynamic thinking that crosses intellectual borders, improving the general competency of the individual.

Like a projectile, the learning impact decreases with distance from the original domain, with the highest gains in competency seen in closely related areas (like, in the instance of car repair, further mechanical work), but the reverberations of the educational wave can continue to be felt in all domains involving a general application of logic, which thus influences by extension almost every conscious decision one can make.

### "It's not worth it to learn - I won't have to do it"

For many tasks, you won't have to do them more than one a year or even once in a lifetime. This is true.

However, as in the previous point, _knowledge isn't learned, applied to the tasked, and then shelved or thrown out - it is transferable_.

Starting is the hardest part. As one acclimates to problem-solving outside of their domain and gets more confident trekking unfamiliar terrain. Making a habit of D.I.Y. greatly reduces the intimidation of it, and the challenge and reward (in skills gained, money saved, waste reduced) even makes it desirable and satisfying for its own sake.

### "A professional can do it better than I could"

This is true.

But rebuttals to previous excuses all apply here too. It you can't, _learn_.

Here's an additional point to add: the professional doesn't have _skin in the game_ like you do. It's not his car; it's not his house. They generally protect profits, and the better ones protect reputation. But they don't have the same interest in doing the job the best it can be done; their interest is solving the problem in as little time as possible and charging as much as they can get away with.

The old adage: _if you want something done right, do it yourself._

### "I don't have the time / energy"

Mane people are too busy working their overspecialized and delicate office jobs and come home drained of physical and emotional energy, and therefore don't have the power left to learn a new task outside of their professional practice.

_Break the cycle_. Personally, doing the same thing day after day, doesn't give me the comfort and validation that it does to some people; learning and diverse activity give me life. Expanding one's horizons, both in capability and knowledge of other fields, is inspiring, and can offer be a way out of the work grind, either through entrepreneurship or a more self-sustaining lifestyle.

Furthermore, outsourcing work often involves just as much expenditure as doing-it-oneself: by the time the problem is diagnosed, calls are made, and appointments and other logistics are arranged and carried, it can be just as time-effective to resolve the issue personally.

### "I get paid so I can afford to pay to have it done right"

Most Western workers don't love there jobs; but many are reliant on (addicted to) the comfort and stability the resulting and regular paycheck offers them. So, as if domesticated, they keep doing it, eating from the hand of a master, even if it means less fulfillment and freedom.

Meanwhile, droning through the numbing, corporate existence with a commute in traffic, many take their paycheck to pay other people to do things that they could be doing themselves, bearing the rigid and dulling "profession" and transferring that payment to a third party.

_Opt out_. Delight in self-provision and dread the boxed-in daily schedule. Self-improvement is its own work, even if lower paying (in the transactional sense) and more fulfilling. Set aside resources for personal growth, even if it means taking unpaid time off from the office.

Ultimately, on a higher philosophical level, that it is merely part of the flawed human condition that _we can justify anything_ if it results in the outcome we desire. It falsely enables confidence in our own behaviors and opinions, regardless of the objective rationality of it. We are all guilty of this in one way or another.

In the case of D.I.Y., the justification we give ourselves involves laziness, repulsion to the unknown, complacency, or even elitism. Consider your rationale next time you take work to someone else.
