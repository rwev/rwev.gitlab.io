In Paul Graham's essay [_Why Nerds Aren't Popular_](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html), the comparison of schools (particularly public primary / high schools) with prisons is made on the following basis, as both 

- hold subjects on premises
- keep subjects alive and non-violent
- distance the leaders and subjects
- form social structure independent of the supervision, which tend to be barbaric in nature
- make an effort to instill teaching, whether moral or educational

Although this connection may be extreme, the points are fathomable. Perhaps a more realistic, less gruesome analogy would be that schools, particular high schools, proliferate fake, bubbled-in societies, with a values system very different than that of society at large.

> What bothers me is [that] the kids aren’t told about [being kept in prisons], and [that] the prisons are run mostly by the inmates. Kids are sent off to spend six years memorizing meaningless facts in a world ruled by a caste of giants who run after an oblong brown ball, as if this were the most natural thing in the world. And if they balk at this surreal cocktail, they’re called misfits.


It's hard for kids to realize that the high school society isn't real, because they've never known differently. If a kid doesn't fit in the messed-up social structure, the next logical step they take is that they don't fit in the world or that something is wrong with them instead of the degenerate kid world.

And this is a hard problem to solve. How do you get kids who feel unpopular to realize that the real world in bigger and better than anything they've ever known outside of textbooks?

Maybe the answer of this is more exposure during the schooling experience to the real world: preventing the bubble from forming in the first place. Showing, not just telling, how the arts and sciences are relevant to their future success and aspirations in the world at large. Reality-check the high school system. Reward the nerds by continually expanding the system of incentives and recognition beyond athletics. Keep achievement relative to the scale of life, not the small-town adolescent popularity contest.

Nerds are the natural skeptics of the situation. If being a misfit in their temporary juvenile holding center means lifelong success, so be it.

> In at least some cases the reason the nerds don’t fit in really is that everyone else is crazy.


Be the misfit, be the nerd, not losing sight of the long and winding path beyond.
