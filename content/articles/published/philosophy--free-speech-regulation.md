Title: Free Speech and the Regulation Temptation

I value free speech, as is the base case for citizens of Western society.

However, my support of free speech exceeds the average. Many of my peers hold the viewpoint, “_yeah, free speech is important and all, but we need to be careful because it could hurt people._”

And I agree 100%. All speech is not inherently good because it is free. Some of it is bad. And yes, some of it is dangerous. Like any freedom, people have misused, do misuse, and forever will misuse the right to free speech.

But what is more dangerous than free speech? A government attempting to regulate it. Why? Because people who abuse free speech with atrocious intentions are in the minority, while a government regulating free speech is able to dictate the majority. A few despicable citizens with an agenda can be little more than impotent. A government with an agenda and control of information is not.

Free speech itself does not impose on the existence of people. Violence does. Authoritative, constraining governments are particularly good at this. Furthermore, abuses of free speech are most effectively fought by reason. Banning something does not make it go away. In the case of free speech, proving a harmful or dangerous ideology to be intellectually ungrounded or morally wrong does.

I believe it is intentional that the Founding Fathers left no room to outlaw any form of speech when they penned

It is up to the majority of responsible citizens to step up and quell senselessly hateful speech with argument. Fight the abuse of free speech with free speech, not violence or law. Challenge it, and show why it’s wrong. This may be uncomfortable or strenuous or more difficult than outright denial, but freedom demands bravery; we’re the land of the free and the home of the brave.
