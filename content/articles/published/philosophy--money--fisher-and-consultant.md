## The Fisher and the Consultant

<div class="quote">

A consultant on vacation visits a remote coastal village and observes a fisherman unloading his day's catch on the pier. The consultant is impressed by his hefty catch, which will sell on the market for a good price, so he asks the fisherman about his fishing operation. “How long were you out?”

<br>

The fisherman replies, “Just a few hours."

<br>

The consultant seems amazed, and asks the fisherman why he doesn't fish longer if his fishing is so productive, as he could bring in a larger catch and make more money.

<br>

The fisher responds that he caught enough fish to feed his family, and has what he needs. The manager seems dissatisfied with the answer.  "So then, it's only noon, what do you do with the rest of your day?"

<br>

The fisher explains: “I play with my kids, make lunch for my family, take a nap with my wife, and go for a walk on the beach.

<br>

The consultant offers his advice: “I've made a career helping businesses make more money. You should fish more. You could soon afford a larger fishing boat, and then a whole fleet. Then, you could set up a processing factory and distribution facilities to cut out out the merchant to whom you sell to and make even more money. You could become a businessman, living a lavish and prestigious life in a sophisticated city."

<br>

The fisher contemplates in silence before inquiring, “How long would that take?"

<br>

The consultant thought for a second. “A couple decades, shorter if you're lucky.

<br>

The fisher asks: “After that?

<br>

The consultant laughs. “When the market is right, you will sell your company and make a fortune!"

<br>

The fisherman remains skeptical. “A fortune? And after that?"

<br>

The consultant gets excited, “Then you could retire! You could move to a remote coastal village and relax every day. You'd play with your kids, make lunch for your family, take a nap with your wife, and go for a walk on the beach."

Unfortunately, while the moral of the story may be obvious, many do not see the contradiction and circularity of goals in the growth-driven world around them. It is common among aspiring individuals in my age group (twenty-thirty) to suppress an independent, freedom-centric lifestyle they desire for the sake of developing a strong career. Instead of finding a balance throughout their life, professional society tends to skew the allocation work to early in adult life, and freedom to later. As time passes, individuals grow roots, regardless of "liberating" career progress. Marry, buy a house and a nicer car, get a dog, have a couple kids, and the freedom (time) never arrives.   

While I generally agree with about the necessity and nobility of delayed gratification to achieve life goals, I'm afraid that too many are being too optimistic about what life during and after developing a professional career or building a company actually looks like. I find there to be a massive over-weighting of the utility of a steady income stream and the effect it has to "free" the individual for what they've always wanted to do.

It also makes large assumptions about the trajectory of life regarding the monetary loot of a committed career and health when nearing retirement. Don't rely on your plans, your yield, or your health: life is unknown.

Both higher income and the stability of such income is almost always connected with the level of responsibility and accountability. While the ability to delegate tasks exist at this level, the chain still exists. The fear of ending up of undesirable situations is always lurking.


### The Irrational Calculation

Some say that "the conditions will never be perfect to do what I've always wanted to do, so why not do it when I can rest soundly in financial security?" as if no point in life is better than any other. But this effectively assumes interchangeability an time, energy, and money: that one unit of surplus can be traded for another in deficit. Is it reasonable to assume that time, energy, and money are of equal value in the ability to fulfill one's dreams as an individual?

You can pay back spent money, but you can't buy energy back. You can "make do" with less money. You can't "make do" with less energy. Overweight the value of energy. Plan for freedom what you want while you still have your youth.

Freedom is now.
