However simple, this site is rich with [invisible](https://tannerchristensen.com/blog/2019/1/5/your-best-work-will-be-invisible) intention.

In the modern attention economy, websites steadily become more frivolous, confusing, and overstimulating, while losing speed and function. 

Some of the excess is perpetuated by advertisers and their powerful psychological devices, exploiting [malicious trickery](https://darkpatterns.org) for monetary ends. Other cases result from general naivety favoring the progressive and [shiny](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-magpie-developer/) over the tried and true. 

## Spirit of the Internet

Aesthetics-first design introduces complication that detracts from the experience and impedes with the spirit and functionality of the internet: _transparent interaction with information_. 

While trends of superficiality dominate a huge chunk of internet traffic, this tendency contradicts the foremost purpose of the internet: to provide an accessible and equitable means of sharing information. The web itself is a network of information. 

Complicated website designs impede the accessibility and making cross-platform display trickier by requiring more design & development resources. They also requires more power and network bandwidth, choking out older devices and using more grid power, yielding consequences in the realms of equality and environmentalism. 

The first and primary goal of web design should be to deliver information. Anything that impedes or otherwise detracts from this purpose should be avoided. Most don't venture onto the internet for a soothing visual experience; most visit first & foremost for the information. 

Enough with describing the dreary state of the web. What's a better approach? 

## Brutalist Design

Brutalist design "adheres to the concept of truth to materials" and can be applied to the design of anything. Web design is one of many possible targets.
 
Within this scope, [brutalist web design](https://brutalist-web.design)  means
 
>  Raw content true to its construction.<br><br>
    Brutalist Web Design is honest about what a website is and what it isn't.<br><br>
    A website's materials aren't HTML tags, CSS, or JavaScript code. Rather, they are its content and the context in which it's consumed. A website is for a visitor, using a browser, running on a computer to read, watch, listen, or perhaps to interact.

There should be nothing to hide or fake. A website only need provide pure and true interaction with information (content) itself.  

### Transparency

Generally speaking, content behaves as expected. Ultimate priority is given to the information and concise navigation through it. 

This means, as quoted, 
> Content is readable on all reasonable screens and devices.<br><br>
  By default, a website that uses HTML as intended and has no custom styling will be readable on all screens and devices. Only the act of design can make the content less readable.

Brutalism starts and stays simple, relies on built-ins and de-facto specifications, and leaves final form up to the user or their tailored device. Information-centric design relegates decisions in presentation to the end consumer: only they know what is best for them. 

### What You See is What You Get (WYSIWYG)

Composition and mechanics should be clear on the surface with no trickery, facades, or superficiality. No guessing or inference should be expected of the user.

> A website is a hypertext document that allows for two primary forms of interaction: navigating a link to another location, and submitting information back to a server. These functions are performed, respectively, by hyperlinks and buttons. Hyperlinks are underlined and buttons look like buttons.

This doesn't mean that  lick animations or other code-based transitions or effect can't be appreciated. They certainly have their place. But they are the cherry on top. The information is the cake itself. Don't let bad cherries ruin the cake. 

### Don't Break The Browser

The browser is the one unit of software that internet users are thoroughly familiar. Users know its interface better than any individual site on the internet. So don't divulge them of their power to use. Keep users in the cockpit and in control. Thus, built-in functionality of the browser should not be interfered with. 

Be very deliberate in scripting, if scripting is indeed required, to preserve state so familiar browser controls continue to function.     

Additionally, the browser knows the end user better than any remote server can: the browser runs on their personal device under their configuration. 

### Performance

Let the browser handle as much as possible, which is precompiled from a lower-level language, tried and true, and iterated program built for accessibility and speed. Using the browser for site functionality is fast.  Code in the browser (ultimately JavaScript) will never be as fast as the browser, or as reliable, or provide the same consistent interactive experience across websites. It is dynamically typed and must be parsed by the client, *QED*.
 
That being said, JavaScript definitely has it's place. It can expand the functionality of websites into domains not built into browser. I use it sparingly on this website (link to map) for domain-specific and contained functionality, and it's only loaded on-demand when absolutely necessary. 

> By embracing its nature and materials, a website adhering to Brutalist Web Design is fast. It allows the system of network, browser, content, and operating system to work together smoothly and efficiently, as they were designed to. Even with decoration, advertising, and imagery, a website embracing Brutalist Web Design will respect your visitor's time, bandwidth, and battery.
