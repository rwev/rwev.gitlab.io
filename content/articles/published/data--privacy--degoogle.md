To "degoogle" is to procedurally cut Google, and other
digital imperialists who profit chiefly from mass surveillance and psychological
manipulation at the cost of the individuals privacy and sovereignty, out of one's digital life.

Many of today's best known tech companies once grew from innocent, grassroot beginnings and originally empowered the free, independent culture of the internet. Those days are long over.

Google, and by extension essentially any private-owned for-profit entity
providing a use-cost-free service to the masses, don't provide their services
as philanthrophy for the good and forwardment of humanity, despite their [heart-tugging
marketing](https://invidio.us/watch?v=6xSxXiHwMrg). 

While they have not build their empires by billing the end user, they have  by _selling_ the end user.

Google isn't a tech company. It is primarily
an advertising company that leverages data on the private lives of users that its tech front collects.   

To degoogle is to fight the mass invasion into our minds and emotions,
which are used to control us from within. The best marketing [doesn't feel like
marketing](https://invidio.us/watch?v=5MitZ-C0tgQ), and the best marketing is
powered by Google and its data on us. 

Their products are used by ever-growing user bases all over the world,
sometimes powered by addiction, other times more benignly by the modern human desire of convenience. 

It is certainly hard to degoogle. It's been a continuous process and an uphill
struggle, due to the cutting out of convenience in digital habits, for the
sake of principle. 

The essence of principle is doing right by your values, regardless of the cost
or convenience.

Unfortunately, Google has conquered the world with convenience. A decade
ago, I, like many others, wasn't aware of the extent of Google's
mass surveillance and psychological profiling machine. 

But today, there is certainly broader awareness, but the cost, in both time
and monetary resources, is too high, resulting in the continued use of Google's
services. 

In fact, part of the reason Google's services are so convenient is not just
because they are well designed for usability: they are powered by your data.
For example, Google can provide great email search functionality _because_
their machines are reading every word. You can search your Google Photos by
words and faces because they are scanning every image. 

> If you don't pay for the product, you are the product. 

This is all in addition to the lack of transparency into the software
that we interact with and rely on every day. Closed source denies the
ownership. 

Enough about why. How does one assert their fundamental rights to privacy and
sovereignty in their digital life?
