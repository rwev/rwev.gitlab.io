To "degoogle" is to procedurally cut Google, and other
digital imperialists who profit chiefly from mass surveillance and psychological
manipulation at the cost of the individuals privacy and sovereignty, out of one's digital life.

Many of today's best known tech companies once grew from innocent, grassroot beginnings and originally empowered the freewheeling and independent culture of the internet. 

Those days are long over.

Google, and by extension essentially any private-owned for-profit entity
providing a use-cost-free service to the masses, don't provide their services
as philanthrophy for the good and forwardment of humanity, despite their [heart-tugging marketing](https://invidio.us/watch?v=6xSxXiHwMrg). 

While they have not build their empires by billing the end user, they have by _selling_ the end user.

Google isn't a tech company. It is primarily an advertising company that skillfully leverages data on the private lives of users that its tech front (think window-dressing) collects.   

> If you don't pay for the product, you are the product. 

To "degoogle" is to fight the mass invasion into our minds and emotions, which are used to control us from within. The best marketing [doesn't feel like marketing](https://invidio.us/watch?v=5MitZ-C0tgQ), and the best marketing is powered by Google, and transitively the data we volunteer to them. 

Their products are used and adored by ever-growing user bases all over the world,
sometimes powered by addiction, by more often benignly by the modern human desire of ease. Google has conquered the world with convenience. A decade ago, I, like many others, wasn't aware of the extent of Google's mass surveillance and psychological profiling machine, and Google's services were free, highly usable, and consistently cutting edge, offering features and performance far exceeding competitors. So we all signed up. 

In fact, part of the reason Google's services are so feature-rich and easy is not just because they are well designed for usability: they are powered by your data. For example, Google can provide great email search functionality _because_ their machines are reading every word. You can search your Google Photos by words and faces because they are scanning every image. 

But today, there is certainly broader mainstream awareness of the business model behind Google (et al.), but the cost to "degoogle", in both time and monetary resources, is too high, resulting in the continued use of Google's services. The [infrastructure](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-3/the-infrastructure-effect) and integration effects generate massive, hard-to-resist inertia that perpetuates the company's expanding control of a huge proportions of internet traffic.

But I've learned firsthand, "degoogling" is continuous process and an uphill
struggle, due to the cutting out of convenience in digital habits, for the
sake of principle. 

The essence of principle is doing right by your values, regardless of the cost
or convenience.

To "degoogle" is to stand by principles of privacy, sovereignty, autonomy, and self-determination, to demand the de-monetization of basic human right of communication and an open-source, transparent interaction with the systems on which we share much of our lives.    

How does one assert their fundamental rights to privacy and
sovereignty in their digital life? 

By diversifying one's digital activity away from Google (et al.) products:

| Google Service* | Alternative Product |
| - | - | 
| GMail | [Protonmail](protonmail.com) | 
| Hangouts / WhatsApp | [Threema](threema.ch) | 
| YouTube | [invidio.us](invidio.us)* for desktop,
[NewPipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org/) for Android| 
| Play Store | [F-Droid](f-droid.org) | 
| Passwords | Bitwarden |
| Chrome | Mozilla Firefox | 
| 

Honorable mentions, that don't replace Google products persay, but limit
Google et al.'s ability to exploit you and your network for data: 

| Product | Description |
