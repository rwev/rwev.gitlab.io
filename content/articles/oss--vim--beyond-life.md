Title: Beyond Vim: The End of Useful Life

Within the first few months of using vim, I saw this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/bm0ihb/evolution_of_a_vim_user/) and related comments on reddit that I sympathized with, adapted to personal experience here.

## Journey of a _Vim_ User

1. Write and save your first file with vim
2. Discover _.vimrc_ and build your own frankenstein _.vimrc_ from snippets on the internet, while ignoring all the nearby comments to RTFM
3. Become allured by shiny plugins and spend 40 hours digging for them in Reddit threads and GitHub links, add them to _.vimrc_
4. Look at _.vimrc_ in horror, and realize that you don't actually understand vim _or_ the plugins
5. Admit that you do need to [RTFM](https://www.xkcd.com/293/) (_read the f***ing manual_), like people said all along
6. Realize that despite customization and plugins, using vim is hurting productivity

So, you switch back to zero-configuration IDE from JetBrains that lets you focus on automating business value instead of your IDE. Relegate VIM to editing text files and commit messages and look back fondly on all that configuration you setup. Miss VIM, but move on with life and appreciate your ability to automatically
 
 - interact with version control and databases
 - find and replace across the entire codebase
 - refactor code-aware
 - manage imports and dependencies
 - integrate file-watching and build tools
 - lint, and resolve warnings and errors with intelligent best-practice suggestions
 - fuzzy-find files, actions, symbols, and settings

all intuitively (at least for the GUI generation) and 
- _without_ cryptic vim-specific commands
- _without_ learning _vimscript_
- _without_ training and ingraining non-transferable keybindings and modal editing
- _without_ the visual constraints of the terminal
- and even _without_ RTFM.

## Age as a Factor of Interest
My generation grew up with GUIs: they moderated our first interactions with computers and beyond. Knowledge of the terminal came only later, when I become interested in development. GUIs, as the point of first and prolonged contact, were comfortable and homey, and the terminal foreign.    

But for the older generations of technologists, it was just the opposite. They grew up with the CLI, and GUIs were something that came later. Perhaps that is why the older generation prefers vim: it is a TUI, and as such shows itself in the place they feel most familiar with: the terminal. 

For youngsters, vim is a sort of hipster, learning it a matter of paying tribute to those who have come before, while the real work gets done somewhere else.  

## An Career Investment
Vim can be grokked and can compete with modern IDEs, but learning vim is a huge investment, and not one for the faint of heart. Gaining a return or reaching break-even requires a commitment on the scale of years, if not decades.
 
I don't even know if I'll be writing code in three years. In the meantime, I'd rather focus on my own valued-added development interests. Going further doesn't seem worth it. YMMV.
