There are lots of common justifications I've heard as to why someone decides to outsource work - work of all kinds: car repairs, clothing repairs, household upkeep, installations, upgrades, diagnostics, etc.. 

Instead of giving my reasons for D.I.Y. directly, I've chosen proof-by-contradiction-like approach: taking on and debunking reasons for not practicing D.I.Y. 

## Justifications of Anti-D.I.Y.
Many of the following (weak) justifications are closely related - they all boil in one way or another down to time and effort. I've tried to partition them as cleanly as possible, but there is some repetition. Call it _beating a dead horse_.

### "I don't know how"
Very common. With the growth of the modern specialized economy, people don't generally hold a quiver of proficiencies quite like previous generations. Intellectual jurisdictions become increasingly narrower with each leap of "progress". 

I think this tendency is worth resisting. _Not knowing is in itself a justification *for* learning._ Even if is a task that won't need to be performed very often - such a changing a starter motor in an SUV - there is a lot of knowledge, problem-solving, and dynamic thinking that crosses intellectual borders, improving the general competency of the individual. Like a projectile, the learning impact decreases with distance from the original domain, with the highest gains in competency seen in closely related areas (like, in the instance of car repair, further mechanical work). 

### "It's not worth it to learn - I won't have to do it"
For many tasks, you won't have to do them more than one a year or even once in a lifetime. This is true. 

However, as in the previous point, knowledge isn't learned, applied to the tasked, and then shelved or thrown out - it is transferable. Getting in the habit of D.I.Y. vastly increases its desirability, as one acclimates to problem-solving outside of their domain and gets more confident trekking unfamiliar terrain.

### "A professional can do it better than I could"
This is true. Rebuttals to previous points all apply here too. Here's an additional point to add: the professional doesn't have _skin in the game_ like you do. It's not his car; it's not his house. They generally protect profits, and the better ones protect reputation, but no _SITG_. 

The old adage: _if you want something done right, do it yourself._

### "I don't have the time / energy"
People are too busy working their overspecialized and delicate office jobs, draining them of physical and emotional energy, and therefore don't have the power left to learn a new task, in a domain that they don't professionally work in. For many, at the end of the day, they desire or can to do little more than eat and continue a sedentary lifestyle.

Personally, doing the same thing day after day, doesn't give me the comfort and validation that it does to some people; Learning new skills and varied, diverse activity gives me life. Others mileages may vary. 

### "I get paid so I can afford to pay to have it done right"
Once again, most office workers don't love there jobs; they love the comfort and stability the resulting and regular paycheck offers them. So, as if domestication, they keep doing it, eating from the hand of a master, even if it means less fulfillment and freedom. 

Meanwhile, droning through the numbing, corporate existance with a commute in traffic, they take their paycheck to pay other people to do things that they could be doing themselves. 

I prefer to opt out of that. I delight in self-provision and dread a boxed-in daily schedule and existence. I would prefer work in self-improvement, learn skills, even if it means taking unpaid time off from the office, instead of tolerating the office and transferring that payment to a third party.

Ultimately, I think on a higher philosophical level, that it is merely part of the flawed human condition that _we can justify anything_ if it results in the outcome we desire. It falsely enabled confidence in our own behaviors and opinions, regardless of the objective rationality of it. We are all guilty of this in one way or another, whether in the area of consumption vs. self-repair.
