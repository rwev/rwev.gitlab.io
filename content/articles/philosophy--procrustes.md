        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes">Procrustes</a>, 
        in Greek Mythology, was the owner of a small estate... [he] has a peculiar sense of hospitality: he abducted travelers, provided them with a generous dinner, then invited them to spend the night in a rather special bed. He wanted the bed to fit the traveler to perfection. Those who were to tall had their legs chopped off with a sharp hatchet, and those who were too short were stretched.
        
        We humans, facing limits of knowledge, and things we not observe, the unseen and the unknown, resolve the tension by squeezing life and the world into crisp, commoditized ideas, reductive categories, specific vocabularies, the prepackaged narratives, which, on the occasion, has explosive consequences. We seem unaware of this backward fitting.
