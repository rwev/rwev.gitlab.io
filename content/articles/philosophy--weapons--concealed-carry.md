Title: The Concealed Carry Mindset

"Rules of the road"


# THe premise
## The failed legislation of Safe
Harder to defend than the circumvent / attack.
You cannot legislate safety - you can just strip the rights from the law-abiding. 



## Lethal Force as a Last Resort
Extracation over involvement. Do not hasten the day. Diffuse. 
Be afriad and have fear. Rationality with no ego. No cowboy complex. Flee.v

## Carry Deep
Open carry scares the sheeple.
People know you have a gun and you become first target.
People can use the effect of surprise to take control of the weapon, making the carrier potentially liable. 
Use tge effect of surprise to your advantage by carrying concealed, without scaring civilians.
