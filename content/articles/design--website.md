To lay into words how and why this website is the way it is. However simplistic is may be, a lot of intentionality went into it. [Our best work will be invisible](https://tannerchristensen.com/blog/2019/1/5/your-best-work-will-be-invisible).

# Overall Design
In the modern attention economy, websites steadily become flashier and flashier, with pretty JS and CSS powered animations, actions, and other forms of visual stimulation. 

Sometimes this is driven by powerful psychological forces driven by the reigns of advertising. Other times it is the general naivity of favoring the new and shiny over the tried and true. 

While this trend dominates a huge chunk of internet traffic, tn my mind, the tendency conflicts with the spirit of the internet: an accessible means of sharing information. Not only do complicated website design complicate the accessibility part, making cross-platform display tricker and more complicated, it also requires more power and network bandwidth, choking out older devices and using more grid power, having consequences in the realms of equality and environmentalism. 

The web is about _information_. The first and primary goal of web design should be to deliver that. Anything that impedes or otherwise detracts from this goal should be avoided.

I don't mean by this that I can't ever appreciate slick animations or other code-based transitions. I do. But they are the cherry on top. The information is the cake itself. 

I don't venture onto the internet for a soothing visual experience. While it is definitely appealing and can make the experience more enjoyable, I visit for the information. 

Slick design isn't just frivilous, but it can detract from the experience, impeding smooth and transparent interaction with the _information_ that is the web, often with [malicious psychological trickery with monetary motives](https://darkpatterns.org).

### "It's not worth it to learn - I won't have to do it"Enough with describing the dreary state of the web. What's a better approach, [Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design) is. It inspired this website.

## Brutalist Web Design
is "raw content true to its construction." The guidelines, are, as quoted from the site:

### Transparency
Generally speaking, content behaves as expected. Ultimate priority is given to the _information_ and concise navigation _through_ it. 

This means, as quoted, 
```
Content is readable on all reasonable screens and devices
```

The default specification of the HTML suite of technologies delivers this by default. 


### Performance
It is _performant_. Brutalist websites rely as much as possible on the browser, which is a precompiled, tried and true, and iterated program built for accessibility and speed. Using the browser for site functionality is _fast_. JavaScript will never be as fast as the browser, or as reliable, or provide the same consistent interactive experience across websites. It is dynamically typed and must be parsed by the client `QED`.

That being said, JavaScript definitely has it's place. It can expand the functionality of websites into domains not built into browser. I use it on this website (link to map). But it is only loaded for domain-specific and contained functionality, and only loaded when absolutely necessary.
