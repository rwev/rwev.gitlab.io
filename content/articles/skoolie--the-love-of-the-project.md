Title: For the Love of the Project

The last couple days at the bus have been frusterating.
The size and scope of
this project is finally setting in. It will be a lot of work for months to come;
I expect to spend most weeknights working on it.

Worked on the bus all gravel parking lot, middle of the day, Idaho summer sun, cloudless. Very hot and
uncomfortable, contributing to a level of impatience.
