Title: Money, The Mutinous Curse
Category: spirituality

## Who owns who?

It's common to consider diminishing marginal value of money to individuals. It's a concept foundational to microeconomics. It's assumed that more money makes us "better off", but how much depends on how much one has.

Money, as observed in the third person, actually has not only diminishing marginal return, but that return also eventually becomes _negative_. 

Turns out this is a biblical concept: money indeed possesses to power to destroy and to undermine. 

The answer is spiritual and psychological. The rich, high society become _more_ attached to money the more they have. It becomes increasingly important, and it becomes a deciding factor in who they are around, and the cycle continues. The climb is addicting. 

With each rung, the stakes increase. Social circles change. and the cycle continues even more aggressively. THe more they have, the less they feel like they have, becomes they move into neighborhoods that are increasingly distinguished by money.

THe worry more about what they have. Larger assets entail more management and potential losses.
